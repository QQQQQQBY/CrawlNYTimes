Despite year-to-year variability, long-term records show a 25% decrease in basin-wide ice cover as well as a trend toward fewer frozen days across the Great Lakes since 1973. Warmer winters increase the likelihood of ice-free lakes, and the Upper Midwest has experienced some of the nation’s strongest winter warming trends since 1970. The Great Lakes aren’t alone. Across the Northern Hemisphere, lakes are freezing later in winter and thawing earlier in spring. Declining lake ice can influence lake water levels and lake-effect snow, and has cascading impacts on cultural heritage, ecosystems, and recreation. The Great Lakes form the planet’s largest freshwater system. They hold one-fifth of all fresh water on Earth’s surface and supply drinking water for over 30 million people across the eight neighboring U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario. On the U.S. side of the border, businesses that depend on the Great Lakes employ nearly300,000 peopleand support an economy worth$17.8 billion— focused around major port cities including Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Duluth, and Milwaukee. The Great Lakes also support diverse ecosystems and are central to regional recreation and cultural traditions. Important as they are  for the economy, drinking water, shipping, fisheries, recreation, and more, the Great Lakes are changing with our warming climate. The U.S. Great Lakes region is getting wetter at some of the fastest rates in the country. The Upper Midwest has experienced a significant increase in annual and seasonalprecipitation totals, while theheaviest precipitation eventsin the region have become 45% wetter — among the highest rates nationwide. The lakes themselves are also warming. In fact, the Great Lakes are among thefastest-warming lakesin the world. Despite lake-to-lake and year-to-year variability, long-term records generally show thatsummer surface waters are warming— especially in the upper Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, and Huron. Along with warming waters, the lakes are also experiencing a decline in winter ice, which hascascading impactson ecosystems, culture, recreation — and  implications for commercial shipping, hydropower generation, and the fishing industry. Ice decline is observed in both shrinking frozen areas and a shorter duration of ice cover. Although the maximum frozen surface area on each lake has high year-to-year variability, all five lakes have experienced a long-term decrease in ice cover with the strongest trend in Lake Superior. The area-weighted average of all five lakes shows a25% decrease in ice coverfrom 1973 to 2023. Detailedice cover mapsshow the spatial ice cover patterns each year since 1973. Lake ice trends are also reflected in the number of frozen days each year (see Methodology). By this measure, ice duration has decreased on all five lakes since 1973, ranging from 15 to 49 fewer frozen days (Lakes Huron and Superior, respectively) now than during the early 1970s. Maps show that ice duration has decreased fastest inshoreline areas. Year-to-year changes in Great Lakes ice cover are linked tolarge-scale climate patternsin the Pacific and Atlantic including theEl Niño-Southern Oscillation. These patterns affect the location of the westerly jet stream  and thereby air temperatures over the Great Lakes — the main factor affecting ice formation. El Niño winterstend to bewarmer and drieracross the Great Lakes region. Thecurrent El Niñomay contribute to thenear-record low basinwide ice coverso far in 2024 — at just7% basin-wideas of February 5. While these natural climate patterns have a strong influence on year-to-year variations in ice cover, the long-term trends toward warmer waters and decreased ice also reflect the overall warming climate. Studies have shown thatwarmer winter airstrongly increases the likelihood of ice-free lakes — and the Great Lakes region has experienced some of the largest increases in bothwinter average temperaturesandextremely warm winter dayssince 1970. The Great Lakes aren’t alone in these long-term trends in response to climate warming. Surface waters in hundreds of lakes across the globe havewarmed 0.4 to 0.8°F per decadebetween 1970 and 2010 — more than double recent rates of sea-surface warming. And across the Northern Hemisphere, on average, the duration of lake ice cover hasdeclined by over two weeksannually as lakes freeze later in winter and thaw earlier in spring. The IPCC assessments indicate that these trends can be attributed to climate change with high confidence. With continued heat-trapping emissions and resulting warming, the Great Lakes are projected to experience further warming of surface waters and reductions in ice durationover this century, with greater ice loss in scenarios with higher carbon pollution. And a recent study estimates that, under 2°C of global warming, the number of lakes across the Northern Hemisphere that experience only intermittent ice cover wouldincrease 2.4-foldto 35,300 lakes, impacting up to 394 million people globally. Declining ice cover hascascading impacts on winter cultural heritageacross the Great Lakes region as it limits access for recreational (ice skating), subsistence (ice fishing), ceremonial (sacred sites), and educational (citizen science) activities. Unpredictable, unstable lake ice is also a safety hazard. In recent decades, thehighest rates of winter drowningshave occurred at times when air temperatures were near freezing, and in communities that rely on lake ice access for livelihoods and Indigenous traditions. Reduced lake ice can also impactecosystem health. Declining lake ice and warming surface waters could also lead to increased competition between cool- and warm-water fish species. The regionalrise in rainfall extremescan also increase nutrient runoff, creating conditions that promoteharmful algal bloomsthat have cascading ecological effects. Although less lake ice can potentially extend shipping seasons, ice-free lake surfaces can also enhance evaporation and lead to lower water levels which can in turn restrict shipping. Larger, longer ice-free lake surfaces also have the potential to increaselake-effect snow, which occurs when cold air flowing over relatively warm, large areas of open water generates intense, localized snowfall downwind of the Great Lakes. Warmer waters and declining ice has likely contributed to theobserved increase in snowfallin northern lake-effect zones of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/billion-dollar-disaster-seasons-2024,Billion-Dollar Disaster Seasons,"January 17, 2024","Click to download custom graphics Click to download custom graphics The U.S. was hit with a record 28 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2023 — part of a rising trend in disaster frequency and costs. Nationwide, tropical cyclones are the most costly type of billion-dollar disaster, and severe storms are the most frequent. Each U.S. region faces a different set of disaster risks each season. Billion-dollar severe storms and floods are generally most common during spring, especially in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, South, Southeast, and Northeast. During the summer and fall, billion-dollar wildfires dominate across the western U.S. and tropical cyclones raise risks in the South, Southeast, and Northeast. The rise in billion-dollar disasters is due both to our warming climate and to the growing number of people, homes, and businesses in at-risk areas. The U.S. was hit with a record28 billion-dollar weather and climate disastersin 2023. These events resulted in an estimated 492 lives lost and over $93 billion in damages. The previous annual record, 22 disasters, was set in 2020. Among 2023’s historic number of weather and climate disasters were: An unprecedented number ofsevere storms and tornado outbreaksthroughout the central U.S. A devastating fire outbreak in Maui, Hawai’i — the deadliest U.S. wildfire in at least a century. Southern and Midwestern drought, resulting in extensive agricultural losses and disrupted commerce along the Mississippi River. Heavy flooding in California following a string of at least 12atmospheric riverstorms. Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida, fueled byrecord-shattering sea surface temperatures. Heavy rainfall and flooding events in Florida and the Northeast — with some areas reporting up to eight inches of rainfall within 24-hours. The disasters of 2023 are part of a larger trend. Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have becomemore frequent and more costly, bringing different risks to each U.S. region. NOAA has tracked billion-dollar disasters since 1980, across seven event types: droughts, floods, freezes, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, and winter storms. Nationwide,tropical cyclones are the most costlytype of event. At nearly $1.4 trillion, tropical cyclones account for 52% of all billion-dollar disaster costs since 1980.Severe storms are the most frequentevent type, accounting for half of all billion-dollar disasters since 1980. The 44 years of data show that all states are affected by billion-dollar disasters, and that eachU.S. regionfaces a different set of disaster risks each season. The varied climates, population density, and patterns of land development across the U.S. influence the characteristic mix of disasters in each region. The U.S. tends to experience the most disasters from April through August. During the spring and summer,severe storms and river floods are generally most common — especially in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, South, Southeast, Northeast. During the summer and into the fall,wildfires (in the West, Northwest, Southwest, and Northern Rockies and Plains) and tropical cyclones (in the South, Southeast, and Northeast) dominate. The table below summarizes historical billion-dollar disaster data (1980-2023) for the entire U.S. andnine regions, showing the month with the highest frequency of disasters, as well as the two most frequent disaster types over the entire period of record. Regional disaster climatologies show that multiple disasters often overlap or occur back-to-back. For example, the Northwest often faces overlapping wildfires and droughts. In the Southeast, the risks of tropical cyclones rise in the summer just as spring severe storms are only starting to taper off. Overlapping or back-to-back extreme events are known ascompound extreme events. We saw compound events in 2020 and 2021, whenoverlapping droughts and megafiresdevastated the western U.S. while the eastern U.S. faced back-to-back hurricanes. And in 2023, over a dozen southern and central states faced overlapping impacts from billion-dollar drought and severe storms. Such compound disasters multiply the risks for communities and strain state and federal emergency response resources. And we can expect more of them in a warming climate, according to theFifth National Climate Assessment:“Climate change is increasing the chances of multiple climate hazards occurring simultaneously or consecutively across the US and its territories.” The rise in compound events is also reflected in the dramatic decrease in the time between billion-dollar events. Over the last five years (2019-2023), there were 16 days on average between U.S. billion-dollar disasters, compared to 82 days in the 1980s. In 2023, the average time between billion-dollar disasters was just 12 days. Having less time between disasters can mean less time and resources available for communities to respond, recover quickly, and prepare for future risks. Often, these risks aren’t equally shared. According to theFifth National Climate Assessment:“Low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribes and Indigenous Peoples experience high exposure and vulnerability to extreme events due to both their proximity to hazard-prone areas and lack of adequate infrastructure or disaster management resources.” As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — from heat waves to wildfires and heavy rainfall and flooding — havebecome more frequent and/or intensearound the globe. In the U.S., billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have also become more frequent and costly. Billion-dollar disasters were 2.7 times more frequent over the last 20 years than during the previous 20 years. Over the same period, the average annual cost of these events has more than tripled from $28 billion per year (1984-2003) to $101 billion per year (2004-2023). The rise in U.S. billion-dollar disasters reflects a mix of factors: First, as heat-trapping pollution continues to warm the planet, many types of extreme weather and climate hazards are becomingmore frequent and/or more intensein the U.S. and across the globe. Second, as the population has grown, so has the overall number of people, homes, and businesses at risk when extreme events occur. Lastly, accelerated development in fire-prone areas, along coasts, and in floodplains can multiply the damage done by a given extreme event. Warming air increases the potential evaporation from the land and transpiration from plants. This process increases the water available for precipitation in some areas butleads to drying in other areas. For example, while most of the eastern U.S. has generally become wetter since 1900, the western U.S. —especially the Southwest— has experienced drier conditions. Risks of severe and prolonged megadroughts in the Southwest are projected tointensify over this centurywith continued warming. As the climate continues to warm, the western U.S. also facesincreasing risks of hydrological droughtdue todeclining snowpack and earlier spring melt. Learn more:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Drought For every 1°F of warming the air can hold an extra 4% of moisture, increasing the chances of heavier downpours that contribute to the risk of flash floods. In the U.S., extreme daily rainfall has becomemore frequentsince the 1980s.Hourly rainfall intensityhas also increased since 1970—by 13% on average across 150 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. From 1958 to 2021, the heaviest 1% of rainfall events became60% and 45% wetterin the Northeast and Midwest, respectively—and 17-37% wetter for all other regions except the Northwest. Precipitation extremes arelikely to increase globally, even in regions with decreasing average precipitation such as the U.S. Southwest, which is likely to facemore intense flash floodswith high future levels of heat-trapping emissions. Learn more:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Heavy Rain and Flooding Severe storms — thunderstorms that produce tornadoes, damaging wind, and/or hail — are localized events with limited historical records — making it difficult to directly link their occurrence to global climate change. Here’s some of what we do know: Although the number oftornadoes each yearhasn’t changed since 1970 (when excluding the weakest events), tornadovariability has increased— concentrated in fewer outbreaks of larger magnitude. And tornado frequency hasshifted eastwardsince 1979, with increased tornadic activity observed in theSouth, Southeast, and Ohio Valley. Since 1979, parts of the eastern U.S. have seenup to 15 more days annuallywith high convective available potential energy during spring and summer—prime time for thunderstorms. Studies suggest that conditions favorable to severe thunderstorms will become about5-20% more frequentper 1.8°F of warming. Whether these changing conditions will ultimately result in the formation of more severe storms remains an active area of research. Learn more:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Severe Weather Warming of the surface oceandue to human-caused climate change is fueling an increased proportion ofintense tropical cyclonesand contributing to an increased fraction of storms that undergorapid intensification. Since 1979, human-caused warming has increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a Category 3 or higher by about8% per decade. The latest IPCC reports conclude that the proportion of very intense (Category 4 and 5) tropical cyclones isprojected to increaseglobally with continued warming. Although the frequency of tropical storms is not necessarily increasing, sea level rise can amplify thestorm surgepotential when storms do occur, putting coastal residents at particular risk. Higher tropical cyclone rainfall ratesare expected with further warming. Greater rainfall intensity can increase the risk of inland flooding, which accounts formore than halfof past U.S. hurricane deaths. Learn more:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Tropical Cyclones Wildfires can be an ecologically important disturbance. But human-caused climate change, poor land management practices, and sprawling development haveincreasedboth the availability of fuel and the frequency of weather conditions that spark and spread dangerous fires. Regardless of how fires start,more frequent hot, dry, windy conditionsaffect fuel availability, fire behavior (ignition, duration, and spreading), and can compromise suppression efforts. According toClimate Central analysisspanning the contiguous U.S. over a 50-year period (1973-2022), wildfire seasons are lengthening and intensifying, especially in the western U.S. Human-caused climate change accounts forat least two-thirdsof the rapid increase in fire weather in the western U.S. in recent decades.

Most (86%) of the 240 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central now experience more very warm winter days than in the 1970s. The rise in very warm winter days was highest in the Upper Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. Warming winters have year-round effects — on seasonal allergies, fruit and nut crops, water supplies, winter sports, and more. Download data:Change in warmest winter days, 1970-2023 (240 locations) The most rapid warming in the U.S. has generally occurred when and where it’s coldest, includingat night, innorthern partsof the country—andduring winter. Winter (December, January, February) is thefastest warming seasonfor the majority (74%) of U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. Locations with the fastest winter warming since 1970 are found from coast to coast, but especially in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. The warming season is also reflected in the growing number of unusually warm winter days. According toNOAA’s Climate Extremes Index, over the last 30 years (1994-2023), winter maximum temperatures have been exceptionally warm for 20% of the contiguous U.S. (aboutdouble the expected ratein a stable climate) and exceptionally cool for only 3% of the U.S. New Climate Central analysis shows similar shifts toward exceptional winter warmth at the local level. Using data from 240 U.S. weather stations, Climate Central analyzed the change in the number of winter days with unusually warm temperatures since 1970. Unusually warm winter days are defined as days at or above the upper tenth percentile of the local daily maximum temperature distribution during winters from 1970 to 2023 (see Methodology). Since 1970, the average number of unusually warm winter days has increased in 206 (86%) of the 240 locations analyzed. On average, these 206 locations now experiencefive more extremely warm winter daysthan they did in 1970s. The rise in warmest winter days was above-average among stations in the Upper Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast.

Chart-topping temperature rankings are part of a decades-long trend of rapid warming caused mainly by carbon pollution. During 2023, the U.S. experienced a record 28 billion-dollar disasters. The previous annual record, 22 disasters, was set in 2020. Severe storms accounted for 19 (68%) of all billion-dollar disasters in 2023 — part of a rising trend of costly, dangerous, and deadly severe storms in the U.S. The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased dramatically.

A streak of continuously record-shattering months and seasons began in June 2023 and is still ongoing. The planet’s fever is forecast to continue into 2024 withan extra warming boost from El Niñolayered on top of the long-term warming trend driven by carbon pollution. The contiguous U.S. had its5th-hottestyear on record in 2023, according to NOAA. Thesevenwarmest years for the U.S. have all occurred since 2012. The annual average temperature for the contiguous U.S. in 2023 was2.4°Fabove the 20th century average. While 2023 was the 5th warmest year for the contiguous U.S. as a whole, it was the hottest year on record for Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Texas. Cities with a record-setting 2023 wereclustered in the eastern U.S.— especially in the South and Southeast. As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — fromheat wavestowildfiresandheavy rainfall and flooding— have become more frequent and/or intense. Extreme events like these put health and safety, livelihoods, infrastructure, and ecosystems at risk. The U.S. was hit with a record28 billion-dollar weather and climate disastersin 2023. The toll of these 28 events was an estimated 492 lives lost and over $93 billion in damages. The previous annual record, 22 disasters, was set in 2020. All but four states(Alaska, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho) were affected by billion-dollar disasters in 2023. The number of billion-dollar disasters in 2023, 2022 (18 events), 2021 (20 events), and 2020 (22 events) was far above the long-term average of 8.5 billion-dollar disasters per year since 1980. The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased dramatically since 1980, fueled by heat-trapping pollution and by the growing number of people, homes, and businesses at risk. Climate Central analysis found that the average time between billion-dollar disasters dropped from 82 days in the 1980s to 18 days on average in recent years (2018-2022). During 2023, the average time between billion-dollar disasters was just 12 days. Having less time between disasters can strain the resources available for communities to respond, recover quickly, and manage future risks. Often, these risks aren’t equally shared. According to theFifth National Climate Assessment:“Low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribes and Indigenous Peoples experience high exposure and vulnerability to extreme events due to both their proximity to hazard-prone areas and lack of adequate infrastructure or disaster management resources.” Severe storms accounted for 19 (68%) of all billion-dollar disasters in 2023, and50% of all billion-dollar disastersin the U.S. since records began in 1980. These costly, dangerous, and deadly storms are on the rise. The U.S. experienced oversix times morebillion-dollar severe storms during the last 20 years (153 events from 2004-2023) than during the previous two decades (25 events from 1980–2000). As our climate continues to warm, certain conditions favorable to thunderstorms and tornadoes are occurring more often and severe weather is expanding into historically less-active seasons and regions. Quick climate facts:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Severe Weather Review the latest science:Severe Storm, Supercell, and Tornado Trends Severe storms are more likely to form under certain conditions — including high wind shear andconvective available potential energy(CAPE). Since 1979, parts of the eastern U.S. have seenup to 15 more days with high CAPEduring spring and summer — prime time for thunderstorms. Studies suggest that conditions favorable to severe thunderstorms will become about5-20%more frequent per 1.8°F of warming. Whether these changing conditions will ultimately result in the formation of more severe storms remains an active area of research. Every bit of avoided carbon pollution leads to safer conditions for humans and for the infrastructure and ecosystems we depend on. The science shows that if we commit to rapid and sustained cuts in carbon pollution, it could set younger generations on a path toward a far safer future with less warming andfewer risky extreme events.

Carbon pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gashas never been higher, according to the latestGlobal Carbon Projectstudy. This heat-trapping pollution is pushing the planet toward new temperature records. According to the latest combined data from NOAA and NASA, global surface temperature in 2023 ranked highest in the 144-year record at 1.4°C (2.52°F) above the early industrial (1881-1910) baseline average. Global temperatures in 2023 shattered previous records for seven continuous months (June to December), spanning the record-hottest boreal summer and fall seasons. Thewarming stripesgraphic, created by ProfessorEd Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, visualizes the average global temperature anomaly each year since 1850. A blue stripe represents a below-average annual temperature relative to the 1971-2000 average, and red an above-average temperature. Another darkest-red stripe has been added to represent 2023's record global temperature. Last year’s record global average temperatures reflect extreme and often dangerous heat events driven by human-caused climate change, including: Heat waves driven by climate changeaffected parts of Europe, China, the U.S., northern Africa, South America, South Asia, and Madagascar, according to World Weather Attribution. Nearly everyone (90% of people worldwide)experienced at least 10 days of temperatures very strongly influenced by climate change during the 12-month streak ending in October 2023. During Earth’s record-hottest summer,45 U.S. citiesexperienced heat made at least 2x more likely by human-caused climate change on 50% to 98% of all summer days. As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — fromheat wavestowildfiresandheavy rainfall and flooding— have become more frequent and/or intense, putting health and safety, livelihoods, infrastructure, and ecosystems at risk. The rise in weather and climate extremes — reflected in a record-breaking28 U.S. billion-dollar weather and climate disastersin 2023 — is consistent with well-established science on the consequences of carbon pollution. According tothe latest IPCC reports:“It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to anincreased frequency and/or intensityof some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes.” As exceptional as 2023 has been, it won’t be the last record-breaking year. It’s part of a larger trend of rapid warming since the industrial revolution kicked off a 17-decade surge in heat-trapping pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. More pollution traps more heat and causes more warming. Over the last 100 years,humans have released CO2 pollution at a far faster ratethan any point in the previous 800,000 years of Earth history. As a result, the planet haswarmed far faster in the last 50 yearsthan at any point in at least the past 2,000 years. If warming continues at this pace, many of the extreme events and harmful impacts that people are already experiencing will worsen and bring new risks. The main cause of rapid global warming today is heat-trapping pollution from human activities. Climate has changed throughout Earth’s long history — including very rapidly at points in the deep past. But the warming observed since 1850 cannot be explained by natural drivers of climate change — including El Niño, changes in the activity of the sun, and emissions from large volcanoes. Climate models can only explain observed warming since 1850when they include the effects of human activities— especially the increasing concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution. Paired pollution and warming trends continue today. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gashas never been higher, and the planet is hotter now than at any time inat least the last 125,000 years. Because we know the main cause of rapid warming, we know how to slow this trend and ensure a safer future with less warming and fewer risky extreme events:deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in heat-trapping pollution. Moving towardclean and efficient sources of energyis key to achieving this. Many of the solutions we need to reduce emissions and thus curtail the impacts of climate change are already available.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index-alert/climate-shift-index-alert-canada-dec-2023,Analysis: Climate change drove Canada’s warm December,"January 16, 2024","January 16, 2024 El Nino isn’t acting alone this winter. Climate Central analysis shows that human-caused climate change made the exceptionally warm conditions across Canada during December 2023 much more likely. Six provinces and one territory had their warmest December since 1970. December 2023 was unusually warm across much of North America, especially in Canada. Much of the country, especially the central provinces, had monthly temperatures more than 5°C above the long-term (1991-2020) average. The three most unusually warm provinces were Manitoba (8.6°C above normal), Saskatchewan (8.0°C), and Alberta (7.1°C), but every province and territory was above normal (Nova Scotia had the smallest anomaly: 2.4°C). Six provinces and one territory (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Nunavut) each had their warmest December since 1970. December 2023 ranked in the top 3 warmest since 1970 for every province and territory except Nova Scotia (fourth warmest) and Yukon (eighth warmest). TheClimate Shift Indexsystem allows us to quantify how climate change influences the temperature on any given day. For this analysis, we counted the number of days at each location that had a Climate Shift Index (CSI) value of 2 or higher. A CSI value of 2 means that climate change made that day’s temperature at least twice as likely. Most of Canada had more than five days with a detectable climate fingerprint. The number of days at or above CSI 2 was especially high in the Northwest Territories (territory-wide average of 13.9 days), Nunavut (13.8 days), Ontario (11.2 days), British Columbia (11.2 days), Manitoba (9.9 days), and Quebec (9.3 days). Tip: Use theClimate Shift Index global mapto see past CSI levels in any specific city and region, on any day. El Niño is certainly an important driver of weather conditions across the planet this winter, and Canada typically has milder winters when El Niño is active. The CSI system considers the influence of human-caused warming (i.e. the long-term trend) and accounts for year-to-year changes like those caused by swings between El Niño and La Niña.On its own, El Niño is not sufficient to produce record temperatures like those observed in December. Instead, temperature records are being shattered because El Niño is acting on top of global warming caused by burning fossil fuels. In the Northwest Territories, ice roads — which connect remote communities in winter —delayed openingin December for multiple weeks, creating higher costs for consumers and companies as supplies needed to be flown in. Similardelaysto ice roads opening occurred in northern Saskatchewan. Warmer weather in December also created challenges for economies that rely on cold-weather sports. In British Columbia, some ski hill operatorsdelayed opening, or temporarilyshut downwaiting for fresh snow. Warmer weather delayedski hillsfrom opening in Ontario. And in Ottawa, the historic Rideau Canal skateway hasstill not yet opened— a delay that has only occurred twice in the canal’s 53-year history. Warmer temperatures thinned the ice on Canadian waterways, creating deceptively treacherous conditions thatendangered the livesof people across the country. These risks are more likely to fall disproportionately onchildren and Indigenous peoples. Dr. Andrew Pershing, VP of Science at Climate Central, said: “While El Niño is important, climate change caused by burning gas, coal, and oil is the primary reason Canada experienced record warm temperatures this December.“ To request an interview, please contact Dr. Pershing atapershing@climatecentral.org. The Climate Shift Index (CSI) usespeer-reviewed methodologyto estimate how human-caused-climate change has increased the likelihood of a particular daily temperature. It can be run using historical or forecast temperatures. For this analysis, temperatures come from ERA5. Using computer models, we compared the likelihood that these temperatures would occur in a world without carbon emissions released by humans, versus in today's world with decades of carbon emissions building up in the atmosphere. This is an established scientific method to determine how much climate change has or has not affected individual extreme weather events. Positive CSI levels 1 to 5 indicate conditions that are increasingly likely in today’s climate.Level 1 indicates that climate change is detectable in that day’s temperature. Level 2 means that climate change made exceptionally warm temperatures in a given location at least twice as likely. Level 5 is the maximum and indicates temperatures at least 5 times more likely because of climate change. CSI level 5 events would be very difficult to encounter in a world without climate change—not impossible, but extremely unlikely. The CSI can also be applied to temperatures that are unusually cool.For instance, a CSI level -2 means that the temperature in question is two times less likely due to human-caused climate change.",True,climatecentral

The latest NOAA estimates show a 99% chance that2023 will be the planet’s hottest yearon record. Lives across the globe continue to be affected as carbon pollution traps more heat and warms the planet. A few of the impacts in the U.S. this year have included: A record number ofbillion-dollar weather and climate disasters(25 events confirmed through November 8, 2023).

Extremecoral heat stress and risk of bleachingin reefs around Florida and across the Caribbean from record-shattering sea surface temperatures. Today’s climate impacts — on health, ecosystems, and economies — reflect about1.1°C (2.0°F) of global warming. These impacts worsen with every bit of additional warming. This is why nearly 200 countries signed on to the2015 Paris Agreementto keep global warming well below 2°C (3.6°F) with an aspirational limit of 1.5°C (2.7°F). But according to theU.N. Emissions Gap Report 2023, there’s still a glaring gap between these risk-reducing targets and global climate action. Even countries’ strongest pledges put the planet on track for between2.5 - 2.9°C(4.5 - 5.2°F) of warming by the end of this century — far overshooting the 1.5°C and 2°C goals. And while there’s been progress under the Paris Agreement (pre-Paris pledgeshad the world on track to heat up a catastrophic 3.7°C (6.7°F) this century), far more is needed — and fast. Analysis in theU.N. reportshows that action taken this decade will strongly influence whether the Paris Agreement goals remain within reach. COP28, the global climate conference starting November 30, is an opportunity to accelerate climate action during this crucial decade. COP28, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1995, will be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates from November 30 to December 12, 2023. At COP28, negotiators will work to narrow the gap between goals and action through discussions about ambitious and equitable ways to limit warming, build resilience, and mobilize finance for climate solutions. COP28 will also conclude the firstGlobal Stocktake, a process in which countries assess their progress toward the goals of the Paris Agreement and ramp up their contributions toward those collective goals. The planetary scale of the COP28 agenda often obscures the relevance of this global climate conference for local audiences. Climate Central’s data-driven resources highlight these links for local audiences around the U.S. and the world. Whether or not COP28 succeeds at narrowing the gap between current emissions and global goals has direct relevance for local communities across the U.S. — especially for young people. Climate Centralanalysisexplores how much warming younger generations in 242 U.S. locations could experience over their lifetimes if carbon pollution either continues, or is cut rapidly. With continued emissions: Younger generations (Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha) could experience between 6 to 7°F of warming over their lifetimes in a scenario with high continued emissions. With rapid cuts: If we manage to keep global warming under 2°C with rapid emissions cuts, younger generations could experience between 2.7 to 4.3°F of warming over their lifetimes. This analysis shows the powerful effect of the choices we make now.The data show that, if we commit to rapid and sustained cuts in carbon pollution now, it could set younger generations on a radically different path — toward a far safer future with less warming andfewer risky extreme events.

It’s also about our warming present. The past 12 months (November 2022 to October 2023) were Earth’s hottest on record. Over this period, the global average temperature was 1.3°C (2.3°F) above pre-industrial temperatures. Recent analysis using Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index(CSI) shows how human-caused climate change influencedheat over the last 12 monthsin 175 countries and 920 cities. Over the last 12 months,7.3 billion people (90% of the global population)experienced at least 10 unusually hot days with aCSI level of 3 or higher, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperaturesat least three times more likely. During the same period,1.9 billion people (one in four people on Earth)experienced an extreme heat streak that lasted at least five days and was strongly influenced by carbon pollution (with aCSI level of 2 or higher). The analysis also shows thatEl Niñois only just beginning to boost global average temperatures. Based on historical patterns, most of the global warming effect from El Niño will be felt next year. Rapidly reducing carbon pollution every year is required to curb the warming trend. Climate and energy choices made during COP28 and throughout this decade will influence how high sea levels rise for hundreds of years.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/climate-change-is-disrupting-air-travel-2023,Climate Change is Disrupting Air Travel,"December 6, 2023","Click to download custom graphics Burning fossil fuels for aviation contributes to global warming — and the resulting warming is disrupting air travel. Flooding caused by rising seas and storm surges threatens access and operations at coastal airports. More extreme weather events, warmer air temperatures, and shifts in the jet stream can also disrupt air travel and increase in-flight safety risks. Last year, 917 million passengerstook over 15 million U.S.-based flights— an average of more than 42,000 flights per day. Fossil fuels burned for global air travel and airport operations contribute to the carbon pollution that is warming the planet. In 2022, global air travel emittedmore than 780 Mt CO2, accounting for about 2% of global energy-related CO2 emissions that year. Emissions from aviation have steadily increased,quadruplingfrom 1966 to 2018. Air travel not only contributes to heat-trapping pollution — the resulting warming now poses new and growing challenges for air travel. Weather currently causes more than75% of air traffic delaysin the U.S. As climate change worsens coastal flooding and extreme weather events, more flights could be grounded from weather-related delays. A warming atmosphere can also increase in-flight turbulence. 1. Coastal airports are at risk from rising seas and storm surges. Rising seas due to human-caused warming are worseningcoastal floodsduring both regular high tides and coastal storms; andstorm surgeis affecting larger areas inmany U.S. citiesbecause of rising seas. Runways at some major airports inU.S. citiesandabroadare at risk of closures, delays, and damage due to coastal flooding,particularly after major storms. Access for passengers and employees can also be impacted if access roads are inundated. 2. Heat can affect plane capacity and restrict takeoff. Warm air is less dense than cool air.Hotter temperaturesat ground level therefore make it more difficult for airplanes to gain enough lift to take flight. Hotter temperatures can causeweight restrictionsfor flight take-off — meaning fewer passengers and reduced capacity for luggage, cargo, and fuel. In some cases, planes may require longer runway distances to generate enough lift. 3.Climate change is increasing the risk of lightning strikes in flight. The potential forsevere stormsis increasing in some parts of the U.S., particularly in the eastern half of the country.One studyprojects that annual lightning strikes in the U.S. could increase by 12% for every 1°C (1.8°F) of global warming. Lightning strikescan damage electrical systems and equipment on large commercial aircraft. The average passenger plane is struck by lightningone or two times per year. Following lightning strikes, planes are subject to inspection and repairs, which can take them out of service and cause delays. 4. A shifting jet stream could mean a longer round trip journey. In recent decades, scientists haveobserved changesin the jet stream — narrow bands of strong wind high in the atmosphere that move west to east along the boundaries between hot and cold air. The influence of global warming on these observed changes is not yet fully understood. Research suggeststhat changing wind patterns could impact travel times in the Northern Hemisphere — potentially making west-bound flights longer, while speeding up east-bound flights. These changes could affect route planning, scheduling, and fuel consumption. 5. Increased wind shear in the jet stream is causing more hazardous turbulence. One observed change to the jet stream includes stronger wind shear at flight cruising altitudes, which can increase turbulence during flights. A certain type of turbulence known as clear-air turbulence can’t be seen by pilots or detected by radar. Clear-air turbulence is more likely to occur during winter months. A recent studyfound a 41% increase in severe clear-air turbulence over the U.S. between 1979 and 2020 — and it is projected to increase further due to climate change. Reducing heat-trapping pollution from air travelnow is critical to limit future warming. But some consequences from rising temperatures are unavoidable, even with rapid cuts to carbon pollution. The aviation industry is faced with a need to adapt air travel for a warming world to protect passengers and employees, as well askeep costs under control. Adaptation measures,including seawalls or other coastal defenses, can help protect existing airports from rising seas and storm surges, but they can be costly and complicated.The Shoreline Protection Program at San Francisco Airportis one example of how U.S. airports might build climate resilience. In especially hot locations or during summer, airports may choose to schedule flights during cooler parts of the day to mitigate heat effects. Where possible, airports may expand runways to accommodate longer takeoff distances.

Or use Climate Central’sCoastal Risk Screening Toolto map localized vulnerability to sea level rise and storm surges around your city’s airport.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/njs-lucrative-clam-fishing-industry-is-threatened-by-climate-change,NJ’s lucrative clam fishing industry is threatened by climate change – and the wind farms that will fight it,"December 11, 2023","By John Upton (Climate Central) and Michael Sol Warrent (NJ Spotlight News) with data reporting by Joseph Giguere (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between Climate Central and the NJ Spotlight News. Seagulls and the setting sun hung low over the Manasquan Inlet as a 125-foot clam trawler motored into a berth at Point Pleasant Beach. The crew set to work unloading the fruits of 58 hours at sea: Enough Atlantic surfclams to fill eight tractor trailers, which hauled the bounty south to a processing plant along Delaware Bay. The Atlantic surfclam fleet fishes year-round from Virginia to Massachusetts and out to the edge of the continental shelf. The fleet sold $27 million worth of surfclams to processors last year, federal data shows, and the sector is largely based out of New Jersey — three-fifths of last year’s haul was brought ashore in the Garden State. Surfclam meat is used for chowders, clam strips and other products, including tinned products. Muscles that the clams use to pull themselves around the seafloor, which are called tongues or feet, are the most highly valued parts. The product unloaded in Point Pleasant Beach was destined to be shucked at the processing plant and delivered to manufacturers like Campbell’s, Bumble Bee Foods and LaMonica Fine Foods. “We’re seeing clams move offshore because of the warming waters — because of global warming,” “We’re seeing clams move offshore because of the warming waters — because of global warming,”Tom Dameron, Surfside Foods But the surfclam bounty, and the industry it supports, is being squeezed by the effects of climate change. Fossil fuel pollution is causing ocean waters globally to warm and acidify, and oxygen levels are declining. Oceans are growing more polluted and wetlands continue to be lost. The clams are shifting away from traditional near-shore habitats, with warming presumed to be the main cause. That’s forcing New Jersey’s fleets to travel farther for the catch and creating a regulatory headache as they mingle with different seafood hauls. “We’re seeing clams move offshore because of the warming waters — because of global warming,” said Tom Dameron, a government affairs representative at clam company Surfside Foods as its clam dredge, the Christi Caroline, was unloaded. “New Jersey actually had a very vibrant inshore fishery, which when I say inshore we’re talking from the coastline out three miles. That fishery is gone.” Even as climate change harms the surfclams, a large-scale solution to global warming is expected to bring a jolt of its own. Dameron and others in the industry fret over plans to construct wind energy turbines in their fishing grounds. The turbines are key components in efforts by East Coast states to aggressively drive down heat-trapping emissions and slow the very warming that’s wounding fishing sectors globally. The oversized turbines will be aggregated into wind farms 15 miles or more from shore, connected to the coast through high-voltage electrical cables running beneath the seafloor. Turbines within the farms could be a mile apart, which is close enough that clam fishermen say they couldn’t work safely between them. Dameron warns that the possibility of having a ship collide with a turbine, or a dredge come in contact with a cable, is something that fishing companies consider an unacceptable safety and legal risk – effectively closing off existing clamming grounds. “We can’t take that risk,” Dameron said. With the surfclam industry facing an uncertain future amid all these threats, shellfish researchers at Rutgers and elsewhere are working to find solutions that may help both the clams and the fishers adapt. Triple-digit ocean temperatures off Florida this summer garnered global headlines containing words like “unprecedented,” “stunning” and “hot-tub.” Coral reefs from the Sunshine State to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef have been bleaching and dying for years, largely because of rising ocean temperatures. While the waters off Northeastern shorelines are neither tropical nor home to colorfully photogenic ecosystems, they’ve been warming faster than most of the global ocean in recent decades, with profound impacts on wildlife and fishing fleets. “The oceans are on the front line of climate change,” said Malin Pinsky, a marine biologist at Rutgers University who researches global ocean changes. “They’re warming quickly. They’re also becoming more acidic, and those changes are disrupting almost every aspect of life in the ocean.” The waters fished by New Jersey’s surfclam fleet have warmed 2.6°F on average since the early 1980s, analysis of U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information data shows, with their hunting grounds warming faster than 75% of the global ocean — and up to 95% in some patches. One of the most striking impacts of ocean warming has been what Pinsky called “a massive movement of life in the ocean towards higher latitudes and towards deeper depths” as fish and other wildlife seek out cooler waters. Pinksy said the unusually rapid warming here is related to changes in large ocean currents, including the Gulf Stream and the Labrador Current, which are constantly shuffling cooler and warmer waters between different depths and regions. “While that’s something scientists would expect from global climate change, it’s not entirely clear if and how this will continue,” he said. The changes are affecting more than wildlife — they’re disrupting fisheries, aquaculture operations and local economies. “To go fishing you need fish, and when they move away the fishing boats have to either travel further to follow them or find new target species,” Pinksy said. “Fish are one of the most globally traded commodities, so this is important for international trade.” ________________________________________________________________________________ Surfclams are among the roughly 100 species hauled in by New Jersey’s commercial fishing industry, which along with shellfish farming contributes an estimated $1 billion a year to the state’s economy. Among those dozens of species is a smaller variety of clam: The ocean quahog is longer-lived than the surfclam, a little less sweet, and favors deeper waters. Quahog meat is mostly used in chowders and soups. Both species are larger than the hard clams and soft-shell clams that are typically sold whole at the supermarket fish counter. Surfclams and ocean quahogs are regulated as separate fisheries with different rules. Boats are banned from catching both during the same outing. The rules against mingling clam hauls didn’t cause many problems when they were introduced, because the species generally occupied different parts of the seafloor. Now, surfclam beds are shifting farther from the surfline into the cooler and deeper waters favored by quahogs, causing the populations to mingle more frequently. That’s making it harder for fishing crews to ensure their trawls bring up only a single species. Regulations aside, separating the two clam varieties creates “pretty significant” problems aboard the clam trawlers and at the clam processing facilities, said Dameron of Surfside Foods. “We can’t have both surfclams and ocean quahogs going into the same can. If a buyer is buying surfclams, he’s buying surfclams. If they’re buying quahogs, they just want to see quahogs,” Dameron said. “We need changes in the regulations, and we need to develop technologies that can separate these two.” Cage tags needed to catch surfclams are more expensive than for quahogs, and regulators didn’t want quahog clammers surreptitiously bringing in hauls containing the more valuable species. Law enforcement procedures, population monitoring efforts, catch and allocation tracking and processing facilities were all established assuming only one type of clam would be caught each fishing trip. Jessica Coakley, a staffer at a fisheries council created by the federal government to inform its management of Mid-Atlantic fish stocks, is spearheading efforts to modernize the regulations affecting species mingling. The years-long slog has been made more difficult by the wide variety of boats and on-board systems used by clammers. In the Northeastern U.S. and elsewhere, climate change appears to be moving more quickly than fisheries regulators can respond. U.S. fisheries regulators are bound by rules requiring extensive environmental and other reviews, consultations with broad groups of stakeholders and multiple layers of approval before regulations can be changed. And the job is made more difficult by established procedures that assume only one type of clam will be caught at a time. “There’s enforcement challenges, there’s monitoring challenges,” Coakley said “The timelines tend to be slow.” Sweeping offshore wind farms have provided climate-friendly electricity across Europe and Asia for decades, but only three commercial facilities currently produce power in the U.S. A small farm of five turbines has been operating off Rhode Island since 2016, two turbines are generating power off Virginia, and although the South Fork Wind project off Long Island is still under construction, it recently started sending power ashore. Construction of towers needed to hold turbines and their blades aloft over the Atlantic Ocean off New Jersey is underway in South Jersey. The state has been working to establish itself as a manufacturing and logistics hub for wind farms planned on ocean sites in the region, though global energy company Ørsted recently blew a hole in the state’s progress when it abandoned plans to construct what would have been two of the first wind farms off the state’s shoreline. While state agencies, the Biden Administration and utilities bound by clean energy laws are preparing for an aggressive buildout of offshore wind farming during the coming years, some fishing fleets, tourism operators, local governments and wealthy coastal communities are opposed to the plans, fearful of their effects on their businesses, tourism sectors and beach views. Some of the loudest critics of the planned wind farms are local and neighborhood groups that fear their ocean views will be sullied by the distant wind turbines. But not all complaints are rooted in NIMBYism. Research published last year validated the concerns of New Jersey’s clammers. The results of modeling effortspublished in a scientific journallast year concluded that fishing around proposed wind farm areas could increase fishing costs as much as 5% through additional gas and labor costs, and reduce revenues for fishing vessels and processors by as much as 15%. The Atlantic City-based fleet faces the steepest potential revenue losses of up to 25%. “Our worst case scenario was, they can’t fish in these areas, and they also have to transit around them if they want to go to a fishing location that’s on the other side,” said Daphne Munroe, a marine biologist at Rutgers University who co-authored the study. “It’s these Atlantic City boats that we think are kind of going to be the most vulnerable.” Surfside Foods, Cape May County and other groupsrecently suedfederal regulators over what they argued was insufficient analysis of the overall environmental impacts from the nascent energy industry and other alleged violations of federal laws. Similar lawsuits have been filed elsewhere against the federal government, which has already leased out patches of Atlantic Ocean off New Jersey, Long Island and other locations from the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast, with more lease sales planned. The Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a nonprofit group funded by foundations, is leading efforts to bring 11 state governments from North Carolina to Maine, wind energy companies, and fishing groups together to develop a regional fund that would compensate fishing fleets for economic losses. The funding would come from the energy companies’ profits. “The first goal is to avoid impacts,” said Kris Ohleth, executive director of the nonprofit. “Then minimize impacts and then mitigate for impacts.” Ohleth said the idea ofa regional fund to compensate fishermentook hold after negotiations for compensation on a project-by-project basis proved to be “not the ideal set-up,” though such systems are being put in place at some projects. She said it’s difficult to parse out fisheries impacts on wide-roaming fishing fleets of any individual wind farm, many of which are adjacent to one another. While the details remain preliminary, Ohleth said the concept of the fund would be that “if there is demonstrable harm, financial harm” from offshore wind energy, “the fishermen could be compensated for any financial losses.” Dameron, of Surfside Foods, sees the development of offshore wind farms on his turf as inevitable. He said he wants the developers — mostly energy companies with headquarters in Europe and fossil fuel giants like Shell — to work more closely with the fishing industry. While he said he’s “very concerned” about offshore wind energy, he’s also “very optimistic” that it can be developed in a way that coexists with his industry. Dameron wants the wind developers to restore lost clam beds away from their facilities, and he credited the industry for funding efforts at Rutgers University to support such efforts, known as ‘stock enhancement.’ “This is something that through the proper research, we can figure it out,” Dameron said. ________________________________________________________________________________ Some hope may be found in experiments now underway at a clam hatchery in Cape May. A team of Rutgers researchers is working at the New Jersey Aquaculture Innovation Center in Cape May County, trying to determine how surfclams are vulnerable to climate change — and to identify strains that are most hardy to it. They spawned the first surfclam ‘seeds’ a little more than a year ago, and now they have millions of individual surfclams growing in an array of different types of tanks at the site. “The surfclam is a really economically important species,” said Laura Steeves, a Rutgers researcher as she showed NJ Spotlight News around the Lower Township hatchery. “So we care about them commercially as well as ecologically. These species are good for the environment.” As well as ocean temperature changes, shellfish are affected by acidity and oxygen levels, both of which are changing because of climate change and other effects of fossil fuel emissions. “We’re really interested in the combined effects of thermal stress, so water that’s getting warmer,  and also ocean acidification stress — the pH is going down,” Steeves said. “This year we have had some extremely warm ocean temperatures, even compared to more recent years. We believe that it’s these changes in water temperature that’s already changing the distribution of the surfclam.” “The surfclam is a really economically important species. So we care about them commercially as well as ecologically. These species are good for the environment.”Laura Steeves, Rutgers researcher Through selective breeding, the research could create opportunities to create surfclam beds in new areas. The work could be key to Tom Dameron’s hope for restoring or replacing wild surfclam beds disrupted by offshore wind development. It could also help shellfish farmers working in New Jersey’s back bays raise surfclams within their aquaculture facilities – potentially creating new farmed-products markets, such as young surfclams that are small and sweet enough to be served on the half-shell. While ocean quahogs can live for centuries, surfclams tend to live for decades. The shorter lifespans of surfclams compared with ocean quahogs might help to explain why their populations are moving more quickly out to sea. Adult clams don’t migrate — the migration occurs when spawn settles in new areas. It’s their short lifespan that has Dale Parsons, a fifth-generation bayman who runs Parsons Seafood, excitedly collaborating with the Rutgers researchers on their experiments. “They’re fast — they grow fast,” Parsons said of the surfclams. Parsons Seafood has been operating for more than a century. It harvests wild and farm-raised oysters and ocean quahogs from the muddy bottoms of Barnegat Bay and Great Bay in Ocean County. “As a farmer, when I purchase my oysters, my hard clams, whatever I’m farming, it’s your investment. It’s money out,” Parsons said. “The faster that shellfish is going to grow, the sooner you get a return.” Now, Parsons has big plans for surfclams in the future of his family business. Parsons has already begun raising surfclams at his hatchery in Little Egg Harbor and seeding experimental plots in the bay leases he works. And he says he has already been in early conversations with an interested canning company. Parsons pointed out that the large size of wild-caught surfclams means they have to be processed and turned into clam strips or another processed product. Farm-raised surfclams come with the promise of new markets – and, he hopes, a sizable new revenue stream. “What we’re trying to do is grow them to a steamer size, where the whole clam gets steamed,” Parsons said. “It’s a different product. Same species, same meat, different products.” That type of innovation gives Munroe, the Rutgers researcher, hope that surfclams will remain a lucrative species. She sees a future where farmers like Parsons are able to not only bring new products to market, but where regulators adapt to changing realities in the water and science brings new solutions to help fishing fleets coexist with wind farms. “I think there are certainly challenges related to other user groups like offshore wind, or climate change,” Munroe said. “But I think that there’s ways to overcome these challenges, and I am optimistic about the future.”",True,climatecentral

It’s virtually certain that 2023 will be Earth’s hottest year on record. According to combined NOAA and NASA data, 2023 global temperatures through November ranked highest in the 144-year record. As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events are becoming more frequent and intense. The U.S. has experienced a record 25 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters so far in 2023. The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased dramatically since 1980. The average time between billion-dollar disasters in 2023 (through November) was just 10 days. Carbon pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gashas never been higher, according to the latestGlobal Carbon Projectstudy. This heat-trapping pollution is pushing the planet toward new temperature records. With just over two weeks left in the year, it is virtually certain that2023 will be Earth’s hottest year on record.This year has now seen a total ofsix record-breaking months(June through November) spanningtwo record-breaking seasons(summer and fall). During 2023’s record-hottest summer (June - August),nearly half of the world’s populationexperienced 30 or more days with hot temperatures madeat least three times more likelyby human-caused climate change. According to the latest combined data from NOAA and NASA, year-to-date (January through November 2023) global surface temperature ranked highest in the 144-year record at  1.4°C (2.52°F) above the early industrial (1881-1910) baseline average. Stay tuned:OnJanuary 12, 2024, NOAA will release global temperature data for all of 2023 and Climate Matters will provide related reporting resources. As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — fromheat wavestowildfiresandheavy rainfall and flooding— have become more frequent and intense. The rise in weather and climate extremes is consistent with well-established science on the consequences of carbon pollution — mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. According tothe latest IPCC reports:“It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to anincreased frequency and/or intensityof some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes.” These extreme events put health and safety, livelihoods, infrastructure, and ecosystems at risk. In the U.S., we’ve seen the links between carbon pollution, global heating, and rising extremes play out in a record-breaking number of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. The U.S. has experienced a record 25billion-dollar weather and climate disastersfrom January through November 2023 — exceeding the previous annual record of 22 events in 2020. Billion-dollar disasters thus far in 2023 have resulted in an estimated 482 deaths and $81 billion in damages. Severe storms accounted for 19 (76%) of all billion-dollar disasters so far this year — continuinga dramatic rise in billion-dollar severe stormssince 1980. All but four states(Alaska, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho) were affected by billion-dollar disasters in 2023. The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased dramatically since 1980, fueled by heat-trapping pollution and by the growing number of people, homes, and businesses at risk. Climate Central analysis found that the average time between billion-dollar disasters dropped from 82 days in the 1980s to just 18 days on average in recent years (2018-2022). During the first 11 months of 2023, the average time between billion-dollar disasters was just 10 days. Having less time between disasters can strain the resources available for communities to respond, recover quickly, and manage future risks. Often, these risks aren’t equally shared. According to theFifth National Climate Assessment:“Low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribes and Indigenous Peoples experience high exposure and vulnerability to extreme events due to both their proximity to hazard-prone areas and lack of adequate infrastructure or disaster management resources.” NOAA’s billion-dollar disasters database,now updated monthlyinstead of quarterly, does not include extreme heat events, however Climate Central analysis found that97% of the U.S. populationexperienced at least one summer day with hot temperatures madeat least 2x more likelydue to human-caused climate change. The same analysis also found that manyrelentless heat streaksin Puerto Rico and across the southern tier of the U.S. were boosted by human-caused climate change. The following list of select billion-dollar disasters in 2023 includes many types of events that are often made more frequent and/or intense in a warming climate. Wildfire and smoke:Climate changemore than doubled the likelihoodof extreme fire weather conditions in eastern Canada in May and June that beganCanada’s record fire seasonand broughtrecord levels of harmful wildfire smoketo the U.S. In August, the deadliest U.S. fire in over a century devastated the historic town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui, resulting in an estimated 100 deaths and $5.6 billion in damage. Drought:From April through September, Southern and Midwestern states experiencedextreme drought conditions, which damaged crops, increased livestock feeding costs, and impacted commerce along the Mississippi River due to low water levels. This widespread drought cost at least $10.5 billion and accounts for 244 deaths — half of all deaths from billion-dollar disasters this year. Severe storms:Of this year’s 25 billion-dollar disasters through November, 19 (76%) were severe storms. This spring, ahistoric tornado outbreakof at least 145 tornadoes caused widespread destruction across the Central U.S., damaging homes, business, vehicles, and other infrastructure. Southern and Eastern states were alsoheavily impactedby high wind, tornadoes, and severe storms. This spring and summer, storms ravaged most of the United States, with hail storms causing damage in Colorado and extreme precipitation and high winds impacting numerous Central and Eastern states. Heavy rainfall and flooding:A series of at least 12atmospheric riversthrough March 2023 produced record precipitation and severe flooding in California that caused nearly $5 billion in damage, while also alleviating multi-year drought conditions in the state. In July 2023, exceptionally heavy rainfall and flooding devastated parts of the Northeast, with some areas reporting up to eight inches of rainfall within 24-hours. Hurricane Idalia:At the end of August, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida as a strong Category 3 hurricane, with heavy rainfall extending into Georgia and the Carolinas. Today’s climate impacts — on health, ecosystems, and economies — reflect about1.1°C (2.0°F) of global warming. These impacts worsen with every bit of additional warming. The science shows that if we commit to rapid and sustained cuts in carbon pollution, it could set younger generations on a path toward a far safer future with less warming andfewer risky extreme events.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/persistent-wildfire-smoke-is-eroding-rural-americas-mental-health,Persistent Wildfire Smoke Is Eroding Rural America’s Mental Health,"December 18, 2023","By Claire Carlson (The Daily Yonder), John Upton (Climate Central) and Kaitlyn Trudeau (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between theDaily Yonder, which covers rural America, andClimate Central, a nonadvocacy science and news group. Will and Julie Volpert have led white water rafting trips on Southern Oregon’s Rogue and Klamath rivers for over a decade for their company Indigo Creek Outfitters, out of the small town of Talent, Oregon. The rafting season, which extends from May to September, is a perfect time to be out on the river where snowpack-fed cold water provides respite from the region’s hot summer. Or it would be perfect if wildfire smoke weren’t a looming concern. “We’ve been in operation here since 2011, and almost every year there’s some smoke that comes in and is noticeable on our trips,” Will Volpert said in an interview. If people have flexibility, he recommends that they schedule a trip before the third week of July when the likelihood of smoke in the air is lower. Customers frequently cancel in late July and August because of the smoke, especially for day-trips. Federal data shows air quality tends to be more than four times worse on average in Jackson County, Oregon, during this period than earlier in the summer. “We’ve gotten very used to saying, ‘Hey, it’s very likely going to be smoky on your trip. It might not be, but it could be.’” Volpert said. But as long as they’re not putting their participants at risk, Volpert said, they won’t cancel a rafting trip because of wildfire smoke. Click to download custom graphics Click to download custom graphics Running a business affected by wildfire smoke has become normal for the Volperts, but it hasn’t come without its personal toll. “I used to get very stressed out and paralyzed with the idea of losing our summer, which for us is, as the owners of this small business, our livelihood,” Volpert said. While Volpert says he’s learned to manage that anxiety, wildfire smoke is a frequent source of stress for many people living in rural communities. The smoke harms farms and recreation-based businesses, can be psychologically triggering for wildfire survivors, frequently drives residents indoors, and recent research showed it’s associated with increases in rural suicides. Wildfire smoke has become apervasive form of air pollutionreleased from intensifying fires due to the warming effects of heat-trapping pollution and a litany of other environmental changes. Southwestern Oregon experienced unhealthy air from wildfire smoke nearly 13 days each year on average from 2013 through the end of 2022 — up from one to two days on average from 1985 through 2012,according to a reportby Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality that used data from the town of Medford, about 10 miles northwest of Talent where Indigo Creek Outfitters is based. Smoke pollution exacerbates asthma, worsens infections and contributes to a variety of other physical maladies. Tiny smoke particles move from lungs into bloodstreams and can directly affect brain health, with research out of the University of Montana connecting smoke exposure to the development of dementia. Its noxious effects on mental health, particularly on rural communities, tend to receive less discussion. Southern Oregon’s Rogue Valley is at the heart of a region synonymous with white water rafting, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities in the Klamath Mountains and Cascade Range. Vineyards and pear orchards dot the valley, and in the mid-size town of Ashland at the valley’s south end, the annual Oregon Shakespeare Festival boasts international recognition. All these activities hinge on good summer weather, and during the past decade, they’ve been disrupted by wildfire smoke, directly affecting wages, profits and reducing overall quality of life. “In rural areas there’s likely more people whose livelihoods are based on the land and working outside,” said Colleen Reid, a health geographer and environmental epidemiologist at the University of Colorado in Boulder who studies the health effects of wildfire smoke. In the valley, wildfire smoke settles more easily and often sticks around longer than it does in the surrounding mountains and plains. Atmospheric conditions often arise in valleys that keep smoke close to the ground, where its effect is the strongest. This can trigger more than physical ailments like asthma. “We’re increasingly seeing mental health impacts,” Reid said. While early research focused on the effects of flames from wildfires, she said “there are some more recent studies where even individuals who were just affected by the smoke could have mental health impacts.” By trapping people inside homes and forcing the cancellation of outdoor social events like youth sports, smoke can contribute to loneliness, domestic quibbling and despair. Astudy published last fallin the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences linked smoke exposure with increases in suicides among rural populations, though not among urban ones. “In rural areas, we find that smoke days are significantly associated with increases in suicide rates,” said David Molitor, a health economist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who led the research, which drew on 13 years of smoke and federal suicide data to track mental health effects. Because deaths from suicide are tracked by the federal government, they can be a useful measurement reflecting mental health, which is otherwise difficult to research and track. And that federal data shows that rural Americans are about a third more likely to die from suicide than those living in cities or suburbs. “I think what’s different with rural people is they have access to guns, and they’re much more effective at succeeding in their efforts,” said Joseph Schroeder, a disaster response veteran and former mental health extension specialist at the University of Kentucky with experience  working at and running crisis hotlines for farmers and other rural residents. Suicide ideation often arises from desperate needs for financial aid and other help, more so than poor mental health. This puts residents of rural communities that have been hollowed out following closures of timber, manufacturing and other employment-rich industries at greater risk. “From my experience, the despair that has become suicidal ideation, or a suicidal threat, they’ve all come from conversations I’ve had with people who are calling me to get out of a situational problem — mostly financial,” Schroeder said. “It’s a poverty problem and it’s an isolation problem. And that looks differently in rural communities than it does in urban communities.” Come smoke or shine, Indigo Creek Outfitters – Volpert’s white water rafting company in Talent – always operates. But on the morning of September 8, 2020, Volpert knew something was different about the wind whipping through the trees around his house outside of Phoenix, just three miles from Talent. The weather was so unusual he canceled the Upper Klamath rafting trip planned for that day. “That is literally the only time that I can remember ever pulling the plug on one of our trips,” Volpert said. A few hours after making that decision, Talent and Phoenix were engulfed in flames. The wildfire, known as the Almeda Fire, was the most destructive in Oregon history: About 3,000 buildings burned, most of them homes. Three people and many more animals died. Click to download custom graphics Click to download custom graphics Analysis of weather station data shows the Almeda Fire broke out during a bout of fire weather — when conditions are persistently dry, warm and windy. The area was in extreme drought at the time, setting up conditions conducive for an extreme wildfire once winds strengthened. It took more than a week for firefighters to extinguish the flames completely. After surviving a wildfire that completely changed the lives of so many in the Rogue Valley, there’s an added layer of grief that comes with the smoke season. “For me, [smoke] causes a lot of anxiety,” said Jocksana Corona. The mobile home in Talent where she lived with her husband and two children burned down during the Almeda Fire. The family relocated to a suburban neighborhood in nearby Central Point, but haven’t been able to rebuild the kinds of strong community ties they had enjoyed in Talent. “My kids grew up in the Latino community [in Talent] where there were always kids on their bikes, people on the streets walking their dogs,” Corona said. “In our new community and our new neighborhood, we don’t have that. It’s like we don’t know anybody.” Even though Corona and her family were able to buy a house after losing their mobile home, she said three years later they’re still not fully recovered. “We’re listed [by the state of Oregon] as a recovered family because we purchased the house and relocated,” Corona said. “But for me, for my own mental health and for my kids’ mental health, I wouldn’t say we’re recovered. I’m still experiencing triggers from the fire.” Corona said she is bothered by the smoke in the air much more after her experience with the Almeda Fire, especially around its September anniversary. Smoke is a constant reminder for wildfire survivors of their own harrowing experiences, and the potential for it to happen again. “That grieving and that mourning is re-triggered by smoke season because it’s evident in the very air we breathe that their experience is not only real, but it hasn’t ended,” said Tucker Teutsch, executive director of Firebrand Resiliency Collective, a nonprofit created to support the area’s recovery from the Almeda Fire. The nonprofit runs a peer support group that provides a safe grief space for Almeda Fire survivors to share recovery resources and talk through problems they’re having in the fire’s aftermath. The group has met weekly since the 2020 fire. In the Methow Valley, a rural region in north-central Washington state, a coalition of community members has been supporting each other during smoke seasons since the 2013 Carlton Complex Fire, which destroyed 500 buildings. The community coalition, called Clean Air Methow, spreads awareness about air quality safety. It also supports people struggling with the mental health toll of living with smoke. “With this mental health and wellness piece, what we often don’t explicitly acknowledge is the threat of what the oppressive, opaque, physical heaviness of being under this white smoke for a prolonged period of time is like,” said Elizabeth Walker, director of Clean Air Methow. “People kind of just say, ‘oh, it’s so bad, so smoky, I hate it,’” Walker said. “But when we ask people to actually give the words of their experience, they use ‘oppressive, heavy.’ They feel depressed.” The number one clean air recommendation is for people to stay indoors, but this can contribute to feelings of social isolation when it’s smoky, according to Walker. Indoor air isn’t always cleaner than outdoor air, either. Older homes without modern windows, doors, ventilation and air conditioners can let in lots of smoke particles. “Make sure you’re indoors, but also make sure you’re indoors with a HEPA filter or an air filtration system,” said Erin Landguth, a University of Montana at Missoula scientist who researches the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure. Because buying and maintaining such systems are expensive, a “key difference” from cities is that rural residents may be less able to afford them. Clean Air Methow has been advocating for “cleaner air shelters” in the Methow Valley to provide public spaces with better indoor air quality for community members to visit when it’s smoky out. They’ve also provided air purifiers to people living in homes that let lots of smoke in. Poor indoor air quality affects countless rural communities. At Southern Oregon University in Ashland, access to clean indoor air during smoke season is hard to come by. The college’s older buildings don’t have updated indoor ventilation, causing workers and students there to be exposed to toxic smoke particles. “I’m lucky enough that the building I work in was built in, I think 2016 or something like that, and it has a great HVAC system,” said Willie Long, assistant director at the outdoor program and climbing center at Southern Oregon University. “I generally have pretty good air quality when I get to go to work, but it’s not like that for most people who work at SOU.” And when it’s smoky, colleges stay open. Southern Oregon Universityissued a policy in 2019that states it will postpone all non-emergency strenuous activity, review filtration, and HVAC systems, and “encourage the use of N95 filtration masks or equivalent for personnel outdoors” when air quality exceeds the rate deemed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as hazardous for everyone. Heidi Honegger Rogers spent 25 years working as a family nurse practitioner before shifting her focus as an academic at the University of New Mexico researching the health impacts of weather disasters and environmental change. She’s an active member with the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.  “Wildfire is a really intense and often traumatizing experience,” she said. Though not everybody gets a diagnosis, Rogers said research shows that between a quarter and 60% of those directly affected by a wildfire will experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). About one in 10 people could still be affected a decade later, she said. “Even after a trauma has dissipated and there’s no immediate emergency, the people stay in this agitated, super-alert state, which is characterized by anxiety,” Rogers said. Smelling wildfire smoke or seeing another community burn can be triggering for those with PTSD, according to Rogers. Smoke has become a trigger for Jocksana Corona, the former Talent resident who lost her mobile home in the Almeda Fire. She sought counseling after the fire to deal with her anxiety, in part because she didn’t want it interfering with her own work as a drug and alcohol counselor. “I knew my physical and emotional reactions to the smoke could interfere with my ability to help my own clients with their own struggles,” Corona said. She went to a mental health counselor for six months who helped her process her anxiety. Corona encouraged her two children to seek counseling as well, but for her daughter, the experience wasn’t helpful. Most of the mental healthcare providers in the Rogue Valley are white and only speak English, which can be a barrier for non-white or non-English speaking patients. “I think that when it comes to mental health counseling for Latinos, it’s definitely lacking no matter whether you’re in Central Point or Medford, which are bigger towns,” Corona said. When Corona worked as a drug and alcohol counselor, she said she was one of just a handful of bilingual counselors in Jackson County – which includes Talent and Phoenix – and neighboring Josephine County. She had clients come from Roseburg, 100 miles away, seeking her bilingual services. Trauma manifests itself differently in every person through experiences like sleep loss, chronic worry, and grief, Rogers said. “People can do okay for a little bit and then they can be triggered by something that goes into their brain and reminds them of this scary experience that they had.” Stress, anxiety, and sleeplessness can manifest in declining physical health. “It degrades our immune response. We end up with more inflammation. We end up with more pain. We end up with more cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure,” Rogers said. And for those not directly affected by wildfires, seeing infernos on the news and smelling smoke hundreds of miles away can serve as reminders that the climate is changing. Rogers said that can lead to senses of hopelessness and anger that corporations continue to pollute the atmosphere despite decades of warnings and mounting impacts. One of the consequences of atmospheric pollution has been stark increases in the number of days each year when fire weather occurs across the U.S. and the world. Fire weather is marked by windy, hot, and dry conditions. The region torched by the Almeda Fire sees three to six more days on average every year during the past decade when fire weather conditions are present, compared with four decades prior,analysis shows. “We can have anxiety and fear and worry about any of those injustices that we’re seeing, or any of those losses that we’re seeing,” Rogers said. Walker, the clean air educator with Clean Air Methow, said it can be helpful to remember that “smoke season doesn’t last forever” during smoky days. “I think that living with wildfire smoke can become this really lovely reinforcement of mindfulness,” Walker said. “This is what it is right now, whether it’s good or bad, it’s going to change.”",True,climatecentral

We cover five key things to know about the hottest year on record. Stay tuned. On January 12, Climate Matters will provide reporting resources recapping the full year. With less than two weeks left in the year, 2023 is virtually certain tobe Earth’s hottest year on record. What does this historic year have to do with climate change? Here are five things. The first 11 months of 2023 have been the planet’s hottest since records began in the mid-1800s. This year has agreater than 99% chanceof being Earth’s hottest on record. Global temperatures in 2023 shattered previous records for six continuous months (June to November), spanning the record-hottest boreal summer and fall seasons. This year’s record global average temperatures reflect extreme and often dangerous heat events driven by human-caused climate change, including: During Earth’s single hottest month on record (July 2023),81% of people on the planetexperienced heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Heat waves driven by climate changeaffected parts of Europe, China, the U.S., northern Africa, South America, South Asia, and Madagascar, according to World Weather Attribution. Led by San Juan, Puerto Rico,45 U.S. citiesexperienced heat made at least 2x more likely by human-caused climate change on 50% to 98% of all summer days. As the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — fromheat wavestowildfiresandheavy rainfall and flooding— have become more frequent and/or intense. In the U.S., the average time between billion-dollar weather and climate disasters has decreased dramatically since 1980. Extreme events like these put health and safety, livelihoods, infrastructure, and ecosystems at risk. As exceptional as 2023 has been, it won’t be the last record-breaking year. The World Meteorological Organization estimates there’s a98% chancethat at least one of the years from 2023 to 2027 will be the hottest on record. The next five-year period (2023-2027) will almost certainly be the warmest five-year period ever recorded. Each of these years is part of a larger trend of rapid warming since the industrial revolution kicked off a 17-decade surge in heat-trapping pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. More pollution traps more heat and causes more warming. Over the last 100 years,humans have released CO2 pollution at a far faster ratethan any point in the previous 800,000 years of Earth history. The planet haswarmed far faster in the last 50 yearsthan at any point in at least the past 2,000 years. If warming continues at this pace, many of the extreme events and harmful impacts that people are already experiencing will worsen and bring new risks. The main cause of rapid global warming today is heat-trapping pollution from human activities. Climate has changed throughout Earth’s long history – including very rapidly at points in the deep past. But the warming observed since 1850 cannot be explained by natural drivers of climate change — including El Niño, changes in the activity of the sun, and emissions from large volcanoes. Climate models can only explain observed warming since 1850when they include the effects of human activities— especially the increasing concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution. Paired pollution and warming trends continue today. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from burning coal, oil, and natural gashas never been higher, and the planet is hotter now than at any time inat least the last 125,000 years. Because we know the main cause of rapid warming, we know how to slow this trend and ensure a safer future with less warming andfewer risky extreme events:deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in heat-trapping pollution. Moving towardclean and efficient sources of energyis key to achieving this. According to the International Energy Agency, global carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from the energy sectoris set to peak during this decadeas clean energy growth accelerates around the globe. In the U.S., emissions of heat-trapping pollution have already fallen 12% from 2005 to 2019, partly due to burning less coal and using more renewable energy. But in order to meet national and global climate targets, this trendneeds to accelerateso that emissions decrease by more than 6% per year on average. Wind and solar energy capacity has grown while costs havedropped 70% and 90%, respectively, over the last decade. And new laws are set to boost these trends. Solar and wind are projected to make upmore than 50% of energy capacityby 2035 in 46 states. Climate impacts  on health, ecosystems, and economies worsen with every bit of additional warming. This is why nearly every country in the worldagreed in 2015to keep global warming well below 2°C (3.6°F) and was called on last week atCOP28to “transition away from fossil fuels” that cause heat-trapping pollution. Butthere’s still a glaring gapbetween these risk-reducing targets and global climate action. Even countries’ strongest pledges put the planet on track for between2.5 - 2.9°C(4.5 - 5.2°F) of warming by the end of this century — far overshooting globally-agreed 1.5°C and 2°C limits. And while there’s been progress under the Paris Agreement (pre-Paris pledgeshad the world on track to heat up a catastrophic 3.7°C (6.7°F) this century), far more is needed — and fast.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/warming-helps-mosquitoes-which-spread-crippling-diseases,"Warming helps mosquitoes, which spread crippling diseases","October 23, 2023","By Bill Barlow (The Press of Atlantic City) and Priyanka Runwal (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between Climate Central and the Press of Atlantic City. In 2019, a mosquito bite helped derail Timothy Ade’s life. In August of that year, he began to complain of severe, debilitating headaches. Over-the-counter medicines did nothing to ease the pain, and a trip to the hospital resulted in a diagnosis of migraines. His wife, Jennifer Ade, was not convinced. She pushed for more tests, she said, especially after Timothy developed a serious fever and had a seizure. Eventually, she got an answer. Timothy had eastern equine encephalitis, a viral illness caused by the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease is rare, extremely serious, and impacts humans and horses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 30% of people with EEE die from it, and many more have ongoing neurological problems. In a recent interview, Jennifer Ade said it was an extraordinary one-two punch that led to Timothy’s symptoms, with a bite from a tick that caused Rocky Mountain spotted fever, combined with the mosquito-borne encephalitis, which led to swelling in Timothy’s brain. “We don’t know where he got the mosquito-borne illness,” Jennifer Ade said. “We don’t know where he got it or how long he had it.” Mosquitoes are now emerging earlier in the spring and surviving longer into the fall, with close to an additional month of mosquito activity in the Atlantic City region. Data from the science and news group Climate Central found the mosquito season near Atlantic City is now 23 days longer on average than it was in 1979. A warming world may bring additional problems with mosquitoes. A mosquito sample collected from Linwood has tested positive for West Nile virus, Atlantic County officials said Thursday. Scientists and health experts are concerned that a changing climate may allow more mosquitoes of disease-causing species to move north, potentially bringing with them maladies formerly seen only in tropical climates. Higher temperatures and favorable humidity in previously cold and inhospitable regions could mean mosquitoes grow faster and live longer. Warmer temperatures might also speed up virus reproduction in infected mosquitoes, allowing them to spread diseases more quickly. A 2019 study estimates that within the next century, about a billion more people in the world may be exposed to mosquito-borne diseases. Scientists expect to see an uptick in EEE cases, which are often recorded in Eastern states and along the Gulf Coast. According to the CDC, there were eight cases reported in New Jersey between 2003 and 2022. A map outlining reported cases shows 22 in Florida and 22 in Michigan during the same period. In a basement office, Patrick McGrath peers into a microscope, looking for the tiny telltale signs that will allow a positive identification of the mosquito remains on a glass slide. McGrath is an identification specialist with the Atlantic County Office of Mosquito Control. Along with biologist Michael “Gus” Gustray, his job is to keep track of what mosquitoes are present in the county, from the harmless to the annoying to the few that are dangerous. A mosquito bite has long been a metaphor for a harmless inconvenience. No one will miss the fraction of a milliliter of blood drawn in an average mosquito bite, and it might take more than a million bites to lose enough blood to die. Preventing dengue fever has long meant teaching people to fear mosquitoes. Now scientists are promoting a potentially more effective way to control the disease — with the help of mosquitoes themselves. But the tiny flying pests do kill, spreading a variety of diseases. Worldwide, mosquito-transmitted diseases account for more than 700,000 deaths a year, earning them the CDC’s title of the world’s deadliest animal. Diseases like yellow fever and dengue infect millions of people around the globe, presenting serious problems in tropical areas. In Atlantic and Cape May counties, the primary concerns are West Nile virus and EEE, each transmitted by infected mosquitoes and causing potentially deadly diseases in this region. In September, Cape May County announced that testing found West Nile in two mosquito collections, including one close to the county zoo in Cape May Court House. At a third location, the county found EEE. “Knowing that West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis are here in the county is a good reminder for people to protect themselves against mosquito bites,” said Kevin Thomas, the county health officer. Mosquitoes can bite at any time of day and are particularly active during the early morning and early evening. “To protect yourselves, you can wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants and use mosquito repellent when outdoors during these times,” Thomas said. “It is also important to eliminate standing water on your property that may serve as a habitat for mosquitoes and keep window screens in good repair.” Doug Abdill, the superintendent of Atlantic County’s anti-mosquito efforts, said his county has seen indications of La Crosse encephalitis this year, another mosquito-borne viral illness. Working on the front lines of mosquito control can be a prickly job for volunteers who give scores of the insects a chance to feed on their blood. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. There are many types, including those spread by mosquito bites. It can cause headaches, fatigue, stiff neck and other symptoms. In some cases, encephalitis may cause confusion, seizures and even death. There have also been instances of Zika in the region, a mosquito-spread virus that can cause birth defects if spread from mother to fetus. And while there have been reports of other diseases more prevalent in tropical areas, officials say those were travel-related, meaning the bite occurred away from the region before a traveler returned and showed symptoms. McGrath and Gustray say there are 63 different species of mosquitos in New Jersey, and 40 of those have been found in Atlantic County. The two keep a lookout for new species, as changes in climatic conditions and habitat will affect where and how the different species can survive and thrive. In some instances, an increase in the range of a particular mosquito species may also increase the range of a disease. As temperatures warm and rainfall patterns change, some species may find new areas. Those could include species of mosquitoes that serve as vectors for diseases, potentially bringing dangerous viruses. “Things are working their way north,” said Matthew Diem, assistant superintendent of the Cape May County Mosquito Control Commission. The Asian tiger mosquito, first detected in Texas in 1985, has continued to expand its range north due to milder winters. This invasive, striped mosquito feeds aggressively during the day and carries equine encephalitis, West Nile and other viruses. It can reproduce in a tiny amount of water — a puddle in an old tire or at the bottom of a potted plant can be enough. “They got here, and they’re not going to leave,” Diem said. A mosquito sample collected from Birch Grove Park in Northfield tested positive for West Nile virus, Atlantic County officials said Friday. At one time, malaria was a leading cause of death in the United States. Fever from malaria killed about 10,000 Union Army recruits during the Civil War. By the 1950s, malaria was said to have been eliminated in the United States, even as it remained a serious concern worldwide. But like Zika and dengue, malaria infections continue to arise in New Jersey, at about 60 cases a year. In most instances, they are determined to have been contracted by travelers outside the state, but that is not always certain. In September 1991, a 29-year-old woman arrived at her doctor’s office with chills, a fever, headache and a rash. The Sicklerville, Camden County, resident was not identified by name in an article published soon after in the New England Journal of Medicine. She had not traveled, and reported frequently being bitten on her patio. Another patient, a 9-year-old from Monmouth County, also got sick from malaria that year. The report found it was likely that both contracted the disease from mosquito bites in New Jersey, even though there had been no documented cases of transmission in the state for 30 years. The authors recommended that surveillance of mosquito populations continue. This year, in late June, the CDC warned of new instances of malaria transmission in the United States, in Florida and Texas. While there are hundreds of millions of cases of malaria each year, primarily in Africa, about 2,000 cases were diagnosed in the United States each year, mostly among travelers. Of those, maybe 300 experience severe symptoms, and five to 10 died each year. The CDC called on doctors to consider malaria in diagnoses when someone has a fever, and to treat malaria as a medical emergency when it is found. The Atlantic County Mosquito Control has scheduled multiple ground sprays for portions of Absecon, Pleasantville, Linwood and Somers Point. Jennifer Ade recalled how she and her husband enjoyed their backyard in Atlantic County on warm evenings. Jennifer was usually the one to decide to head inside as mosquitoes began to take their bloody toll. “I always say I’m the sweetest because I’m the one getting bit,” she said. The bites just didn’t seem to bother her husband as much. He worked with the Weymouth Township Public Works Department and enjoyed the outdoors in his free time. Now 46, Timothy has difficulty walking and suffers from short-term memory loss. Jennifer said it would be impossible for him to perform the physical labor of his old job, and the couple rely on a home health aide. Jennifer said she tries to remain positive, but her husband has found it extremely difficult to adjust to his new limitations. “It has destroyed our lives,” she said.",True,climatecentral

Although current policies won’t get the U.S. all the way to its 2030 target, they’re projected to spur clean energy growth across the country that will continue long after 2030. Most U.S. states are set to experience a boom in wind and solar energy capacity by 2035, according to research led by Princeton University. By 2035, solar and wind are expected to make up more than 50% of energy capacity in 46 states. Along with progressing toward U.S. climate targets, solar and wind energy growth under current policies is also projected to boost energy jobs and improve air quality. Another low-carbon energy source that could help cut emissions is nuclear energy, which accounts for one-fifth of electricity in the U.S. A new report,Climate Central Solutions Brief: Nuclear Energy,covers the opportunities and barriers for nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Earth has been on arecord-shattering heat streaksince June, and the rising risks of extremes have been on full display: devastating wildfires andrecord smoke levels; summerheat boosted by climate changein U.S. cities;heavy rainfalland flash floods;ocean heatwavesand coral bleaching; arecord numberof billion-dollar disasters. Every bit of avoided warming counts toward a safer future, and the U.S. is among nearly 200 countries that joined theParis Agreementto limit warming. As part of its contribution, the U.S. has set the followinggoals: By 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels By 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity By 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy Recent landmark policies are moving the U.S. toward its climate goals: The 2022Inflation Reduction Act(IRA) contains $369 billion to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The law is estimated to have a greater impact on U.S. climate goals than any previous policy. The 2021Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act(IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, invests $1.2 trillion in infrastructure that will be more resilient and will help reduce emissions. In order to understand the potential impact of these policies, and track progress towards U.S. climate targets, Princeton University scientists developed theRapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT)Project. The REPEAT Project provides regular and independent research and analysis on the environmental and economic impacts of federal energy and climate policies. Learn moreaboutthe REPEAT Project, read theirlatest reportand relatedpeer-reviewed research, and explore thedata. Here we highlight some of the progress that can be made in the electricity sector with current U.S. policies (including IRA and IIJA), if we’re optimistic about their adoption and effectiveness. Before current policies were enacted, the U.S. was cutting greenhouse gas emissions by about 2% per year. But this pace is not fast enough to meet national targets by 2030. With the addition of the IRA, the pace jumps to 4% per year. But for the U.S. to reach its 2030 goal, emissions cuts closer to 6% per year would be needed. By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005. That is a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this would be significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of the national 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels). The good news is that progress is projected to continue beyond 2030 as the energy transition gains even more momentum. By 2035, the U.S. could be more than 50% below 2005 levels with current policies. Overone-third of the emissions cutsfrom current policies are expected to come from the electric power sector — largely due to accelerating wind and solar energy growth. Solar and wind energy are key to reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and decreasing emissions from burning fossil fuels for energy. And every U.S. state has a role to play in the energy transition. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is set to happen in all lower 48states in the coming decades. In 27 states, combined wind and solar capacity could increase at least five-fold by 2035 compared to 2024 projections. The following 12 states could see at least a ten-fold increase in combined wind and solar capacity by 2035 compared to 2024 projections: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia. By 2035: Utility-scale solar will lead the way in 28 states — especially in Nevada, Georgia, Alabama, Ohio, Arizona, and Florida. Large-scale wind farms will be the leading source of growth in another 18 states — especially North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas, Idaho, and Illinois. Offshore wind is projected to lead in two states: Massachusetts and New Jersey. By 2035, solar and wind are expected to make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of 48 total states analyzed. In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035. The outlook for the U.S. is part of a global trend. Current policies are set to accelerate clean energy transitions around the world this decade. According to the International Energy Association's latestWorld Energy Outlook, renewables (including wind and solar) are set to make up nearly 50% of the global electricity mix by 2030. In the U.S., current policies could have a major impact on reducing emissions, spurring the energy transition, and ensuring asafer future for younger generations. Along with helping to achieve national emissions targets, solar and wind energy growth is projected to spur millions ofnew energy jobsin the U.S. by 2035, especially related to solar energy and electricity transmission. Reduced reliance on fossil fuels in the U.S. electricity supply also means less fine particle pollution andhealthier air quality— saving lives and health care costs. Many states are cutting carbon pollution to ensure a safer future. States havealready reduced emissionsby 19% on average, from 2005 to 2020. But accelerated action is needed to meet national targets.

Analysis using Climate Central’sClimate Shift Indexshows how human-caused climate change influenced heat over the last 12 months in 175 countries and 920 cities. Over that time, 90% of people worldwide (and 49% in the U.S.) experienced at least 10 days of temperatures very strongly influenced by climate change. One-in-four people on Earth faced extreme, persistent, and dangerous heat waves driven by carbon pollution. Out of 700 largest cities, Houston, Texas experienced the longest streak of extreme heat made more likely by carbon pollution: 22 days. The rising frequency and intensity of heat waves across the globe is consistent with the consequences of carbon pollution — mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. Read the report: The hottest 12-month stretch in recorded historyDownload data The past 12 months have been hot — by the data, and by the experience of people around the world. This year, Earth had itshottest Northern Hemisphere summerandhottest month(July) ever recorded. So it’s no surprise that the entire year is shaping up to be the hottest since records began in the 1800’s. The rising frequency and intensity of extreme heat across the U.S. and around the globe is consistent withwell-established scienceon the consequences of carbon pollution — mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. Ahead ofglobal climate negotiationslater this month, Climate Central analyzed the fingerprints of climate change on air temperatures and extreme heat waves over the past 12 months (November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023). Climate change attribution science quantifieswhetherandto what extenthuman-caused climate change altered the likelihood of specific extreme weather events. Climate Central’s daily attribution system, theClimate Shift Index(CSI), applies thelatest peer-reviewed methodologyto map the influence of human-caused climate change on daily local temperatures and multi-day extreme heat events across the globe. For example, a CSI level of 3 indicates that a local daily temperature was madeat least three times more likelydue to climate change. Learn more about attribution science and the CSIhere. New Climate Central analysis using theClimate Shift Index(CSI) quantifies the influence of human-caused climate change on extreme heat in 175 countries and 920 cities during Earth’s record-hottest 12 month period (November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023). The past 12 months (November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023) were Earth’s hottest on record.Over this period, the global average temperature was 1.3°C (2.3°F) above pre-industrial temperatures. Over the last 12 months, 7.3 billion people (90% percent of the global population) experienced at least 10 days of temperatures strongly affected by climate change.These days had aCSI level of 3 or higher, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperaturesat least three times more likely. During the same period, 5.8 billion people (73% of the global population) experienced more than a month’s worth of these temperatures. Climate Central also analyzed how climate change influenced exposure to extreme heat (above the local 99th percentile) that persisted for at least five days. Over the last 12 months, 1.9 billion people (one in four people) experienced an extreme heat streak that lasted at least five days and was strongly influenced by carbon pollution.These multi-day heat streaks had a CSI of 2 or higher, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperaturesat least two times more likely. El Niñois just beginning to boost temperatures.Based on historical patterns, most of the global warming effect will be felt next year. Rapidly reducing carbon pollution every year is required to halt the warming trend. Nearly half (49%) of the U.S. population (162.6 million people)experienced 10 or more days at CSI level 3 or higher during the last 12 months. Over one-quarter of the U.S. population(85.6 million people, or 26%) experienced 30 or more days with heat at CSI level 3 or higher during the same period. Five of the 10 large global cities (of at least 1 million people) that experienced the most days with extreme heat (above the local 99th percentile) were in the U.S.:Houston (56 days), Austin (45 days), San Antonio (44 days), New Orleans (42 days), and Miami (34 days). Out of 700 large global cities (of at least 1 million people),Houston, Texas experienced the longest streak of extreme heatmade more likely by carbon pollution: 22 days. New Orleans, La., tied with two cities in Indonesia(Tangerang and Jakarta) for having the second-longest streak of extreme heat (17 days). During the last six months (May-October 2023), six U.S. states had average CSI levels of 1 or higher: Hawai’i (2.8), Louisiana (1.9), Texas (1.9), Florida (1.8), New Mexico (1.8), and Arizona (1.3). Jamaica had the highest average CSI of any country analyzed (4.5 out of a maximum of 5).On the average day over the last 12 months, Jamaicans experienced average temperatures made at least four times more likely by human-caused climate change. Guatemala (4.4) and Rwanda (4.1)also had average CSI levels above 4 during the last 12 months. Out of 700 large cities (of at least 1 million people) analyzed,the two largest cities in the Dominican Republic experienced the most days with extreme heat(above the local 99th percentile): Santo Domingo (79 days) and Santiago (56 days). Santiago tied with Houston, Texas (56 days). The influence of carbon pollution on heat was strongest in the developing world.Extreme heat driven by climate change is also accelerating among the world’s richest countries. Three countries had an average CSI level of 1 or higherduring the first six months analyzed (November 2022 to April 2023): Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Mexico. Nine countrieshad an average CSI level of 1 or higherduring the last six months analyzed (May to October 2023): Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Mexico, India, Japan, Italy, Brazil, France, and Turkey.  During this same period, the mean CSI increased in all G20 countries, with the exception of Germany and Russia.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/after-the-storm-damp-moldy-homes-2023,"After the Storm: Damp, Moldy Homes","August 9, 2023","Climate change increases risks of flooding from heavy rainfall, more intense storms, and rising sea levels. Damp conditions in flooded buildings support the growth of mold and other microbes that can contribute to poor indoor air quality and a range of potential health issues. Mold can begin growing in water-damaged buildings just days after a storm. But there are ways to manage mold risks in the aftermath and protect human health. Climate Central’s new report,After the Storm: Health risks from damp, moldy homes,explains the weather and climate trends that influence flood risk, and summarizes potential health risks from poor indoor air quality. Heavier precipitation, more intense storms, and rising sea levels—all driven by a warming climate—contribute to increased risks of flooding and associated health impacts.Water-damaged homesprovide ideal growing conditions formolds(types of fungi) andother microbesthat can harm respiratory health and contribute to other illnesses. A warming atmosphere canhold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall. Extreme rainfall events—which bring an amount of rain well above normal for the time and location, over a period of hours or even minutes—have been on the risein the U.S. since the 1980s. These intense bursts of rainfall can elevate local risks of flooding. Climate Central analyzedhourly rainfall intensityacross the U.S. between 1970 and 2022.  During this period, 136 of 150 U.S. locations analyzed have experienced increasing hourly rainfall intensity since 1970. Climate Central’sExtreme Weather Toolkit: Heavy Rain and Floodingincludes more resources on the links between climate change and extreme rainfall. Atmospheric riversare ribbons of moisture carried by strong winds in the lower atmosphere. Climate change can boost conditions that make these events more likely or more intense. They vary in theirstrength and impacts, but strong atmospheric rivers can cause a range of serious hazards—including floods and the resultinghealth risks. Hurricanes and tropical storms bringrisks of heavy rains and flooding, especially to coastal communities. Warming sea surface temperatures due to human-caused climate change fuel an increased proportion ofintense tropical cyclonesand contribute to an increased fraction of storms that undergorapid intensification. Since 1979, human-caused warming has increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) by about8% per decade. The latest IPCC reports conclude that the proportion of very intense (Category 4 and 5)tropical cyclonesis projected toincrease globallywith continued global warming. Climate Central’sExtreme Weather Toolkit: Tropical Cyclonesincludes more resources on the links between climate change and tropical cyclones—themost costlybillion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the U.S. Rising sea levels due to human-caused warming are worseningcoastal floodsduring both regular high tides and coastal storms.Storm surgeproduced by coastal storms is affecting larger areas inmany U.S. citiesbecause of rising seas. Extreme weather events and floods can be dangerous—and the risks to health and safety don’t pass with the storm. One such risk ispoor air quality in damp, moldy homesand buildings. In the daysfollowing a storm or flood, mold can begin growing on absorbent materials such as carpets, drywall, and furniture. Climate Central’s reportAfter the Storm: Health risks from damp, moldy homessummarizes research into the potential health risks from poor indoor air quality following extreme weather events. Molds can beharmful to some people, depending on factors such as individual sensitivity and the amount or kinds of mold. Studies have identifiedacute and chronic health effectsassociated with dampness and indoor mold exposure, ranging from mildallergic reactionsand respiratory infections to worsened asthma and severe illness. Childrenand individuals with respiratory issues orweakened immune systemsmay be especially vulnerable to health issues frommold exposure after flooding. Whilemore research is neededto better understand the potential impacts of mold, public health officials recommend minimizing exposure to moldy homes. If you need to remain in a home with mold for a period of time, there are ways to minimize exposure, including: Discarding wet, moldy items. Sealing off moldy areas until they can be cleaned. Maintainingindoor humidity between 30-50%to prevent more mold growth. Using adequately sized portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)filtersin living spaces and (especially) bedrooms to improve air quality before mold remediation. To protect against flooding and extreme precipitation, homeowners or renters can implementlow-cost indoor projects recommended by FEMA. Communities caninvestin flood management systems, green infrastructure, and watershed restoration. Climate Central'sPartnership Journalism programcollaborated with news outlets in New Jersey and Florida to investigate the impacts of mold on families following tropical storms.

Mold is just one of many potential hazards in a storm-damaged home. Other safety hazards include debris, structural damage, or downed electrical wires.Taking precautionsfollowing a storm, flood, or other natural disaster can protect health and safety.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/heavier-rain-drought-and-hotter-days-challenge-scs-peanut-industry,"Heavier rain, drought and hotter days challenge SC's peanut industry","May 31, 2023","by Caitlin Looby (Climate Central) and Sonya Stevens (ABC News 4) This story was produced through a collaboration between News 4 in Charleston and Climate Central, a nonadvocacy science and news group. Johnny McMillan has noticed that summers on his 600-acre farm in Colleton County are getting hotter. That, with worsening bouts of heavy rain and drought, are making it harder and more expensive to grow peanut plants in South Carolina - one of America's main growing hubs for the popular legumes. ""Our summers are hotter than they used to be, but as long as you get some rainfall we do okay,"" said McMillan, who grows peanuts, cotton, corn and sometimes soybeans. ""You want plenty of rain but you don’t want it just bogging down wet all the time."" Summertime averages in South Carolina’s Lowcountry counties have warmed nearly 2F since 1970 and the frequency of extreme heat days are on the rise. During the next few decades, hotter summers and intensifying rainfall threaten to reduce yields of the important crop - a challenge that experts are aiming to manage through special crop breeding approaches. Warming temperatures are also causing rain to fall more heavily, creating conditions that are ripe for the fungal pests that plague McMillan's peanut crop. ""If it gets really wet you can’t spray, and disease gets away from you,"" he said. Sruthi Narayanan, an associate professor at Clemson University who studies how climate change impacts crops, is among the researchers working with plant breeders to create new varieties of peanut plants that will be more resilient to the effects of heat-trapping pollution. ""Climate change is now impacting our crops, like peanuts, in a very serious way,"" Narayanan said. More than 5.5 billion pounds of peanuts were produced last year in the U.S. and South Carolina is a top producer of peanuts. Peanut production is a growing industry in South Carolina, generating nearly $73 million last year. The state ranks sixth for peanut growing in the U.S. after Georgia, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas. Calhoun, Orangeburg, and Hampton counties were the top producing counties in South Carolina last year. Colleton and Dorchester counties are two other counties in the Lowcountry known for high peanut yields. McMillan said his farm's peanuts are planted in May each year, and harvests start in October and end in the middle of November. There are three kinds of peanuts grown in South Carolina: Virginia, Valencia, and Runner. Virginia, nicknamed ""ballpark"", and Valencia are the ones best for boiling and roasting. Runner peanuts become peanut butter. Peanuts are an important crop in the U.S. because they provide plant protein. They are also a major oil seed crop. According to Narayanan, peanuts are regarded as a climate smart crop because all parts of the plants can be used. There is the nut that people eat and the other parts of the plant can be added back to the soil to increase organic matter, which helps plants grow and keeps the soil moist. Peanut plants are legumes, meaning they form seeds within a pod or the ""shell"" that winds up on the concrete floor at a baseball game. Legumes also help other crops by adding nitrogen to the soil. Peanut plants need conditions that are ""just right"". The plants are grown in low rows and will flower a few weeks after they are planted. The plant can pollinate itself, and after that the pods will fill with seeds underground. Pod filling is the most important part because that creates the peanuts that people consume, according to Narayanan. While peanut plants can grow in a wide range of temperatures, flowering and pod filling can only happen with a small temperature window. Any warmer and the plant will suffer from heat stress, stunting plant growth, and damaging the quality of the peanut. They also need a lot of water during this time, but not too much. Narayanan said rising heat is the stressor that is most problematic, while McMillan said heavier rain is his biggest challenge. Farmers can irrigate or water more during drier times, but there isn't a lot they can do when temperatures are too hot. One solution is to develop new varieties of peanut plants. And that's what Narayanan does. She works with plant breeders to figure out which genes will help make peanut plants more tolerant to heat. It can be tricky work. Not only are there lots of genes to look at, but Narayanan has to make sure they're modifying ones that will be passed onto future generations. Her goal is to create new varieties of peanuts that can withstand hotter temperatures, but also can breed under a wider range of temperatures. As for the changing weather, McMillan is hopeful that science will continue to help South Carolina's peanut industry meet the demand. ""The technology that has gone into seed production and development has really helped us with yields,"" McMillan said, adding that they are always looking for better varieties. ""We do a lot better with just about all crops than we did 50 years ago.""",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/the-power-of-urban-trees-2023,The Power of Urban Trees,"May 3, 2023","America’s growing urban population is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, heavy rainfall, and poor air quality—all amplified in a warming world. Climate Central’s new report,The Power of Urban Trees, explains how trees can alleviate impacts from urbanization and help communities adapt to climate change. By cooling air and surface temperatures, trees reduce the health hazards of extreme heat. Trees also slow and soak up rainfall; filter the air; and absorb harmful carbon pollution. Climate Central analysis using the U.S. Forest Service’s i-Tree data shows the estimated annual benefits of urban trees in 242 U.S. cities (defined by county or counties). Download local dataRead the full report Around 80% of Americans live in urban areas, and this could jump tonearly 90%by 2050. As urban populations expand, so do concerns aboutclimate risks in cities. Built environments can boost risks associated withextreme heatandheavy rainfall eventsmade more likely in a warming world. Cities are generally warmer than surrounding landscapes due to theurban heat island effect, which occurs because pavement and buildings retain heat and reflect it back into the surrounding air. Paved surfaces also don’t absorb rainwater, and are therefore prone to flooding fromstormwater runoff. Concentrated human activity (especially traffic) in urban areas contributes to poor air quality. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases and other tiny particles into the air, which can cause severehealth hazards. Cities contribute up to60% of total greenhouse gas emissionsacross the globe. Cities are incorporating natureinto their infrastructure to help alleviate impacts of urbanization and build resilient communities. Agrowing body of researchshows thaturban forests—the trees in cities and surrounding communities—and other greenspaces can help cities adapt to climate change. Trees provide critical benefits in an increasingly warmer and urbanized world. Trees help communities: Reduce heat.Trees reduce the risks of extreme heat, the leading weather-relatedcause of death. Tree canopy helps reduce surface temperatures and cool the air by shading heat-absorbing buildings and pavement. Shade trees also provide immediate relief for people working, playing, orexercising outdoors. Avoid flooding from stormwater runoff.Tree canopy slows rainfall, while roots and soil filter and absorb water—minimizing the amount of stormwater that flushes over pavement and contributes to runoff and flooding. Improve air quality.Leaves absorb harmful gases such asozoneandnitrogen dioxide, and intercept hazardousparticulate matterthat pollute the air. Remove and store greenhouse gases.Trees remove CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. They absorb CO2 during photosynthesis and store the carbon in their biomass (including their leaves, trunks, branches, and roots). Protect health and provide connection to nature.Studies have linked trees and time spent in nature to a number ofphysical and mental health benefits. Climate Central’s new report further explains“The Power of Urban Trees”and discusses how communities can protect and support urban forests to continue benefitting from them. The U.S. Forest Service and partner organizations developed i-Tree—a series offree web toolsthat map and measure urban forests and their benefits. Climate Central summarized i-Tree data to estimate annual tree benefits for 242 cities (defined by county or counties) across the continental U.S. Each year, trees across these counties help avoid about 110 billion gallons of stormwater runoff (equivalent to nearly 167,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools). These urban trees also reduce nearly 4 billion pounds of air pollution and absorb roughly 150 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (or CO2e, including CO2 and other greenhouse gases) annually. The top three most populous cities in the analysis—Los Angeles (Los Angeles County), New York City (across five counties), and Chicago (Cook County)—rank among thebiggest contributors of global greenhouse gas emissions. Collectively, trees across these counties help absorb approximately 1 million tons of CO2e each year (equivalent to the annual GHG emissions from about 192,000 cars). Top-benefitting counties are spread across the country, but a few locations appear more than once at the top of the rankings, including:Aroostook and Penobscot Counties in Maine; Lane County, Oregon;andHumboldt County, California *Based on annual estimates of benefits from the U.S. Forest Service i-Tree tools.

Climate Central assessed mosquito weather trends from 1979 to 2022 in 242 U.S. locations. Over this period, 173 locations saw annual mosquito days increase—by 16 days on average. The Southeast and South experience the most annual mosquito days (over 50% of the year). The Ohio Valley and Northeast saw the largest region-wide increase in mosquito days since 1979. Mosquitoes thrive in warm, humid weather. As our climate warms, many places are becoming more hospitable to mosquitoes—and the health risks they can carry. A new Climate Central analysis assessed long-term trends in mosquito daysacross the contiguous U.S. In this analysis, a mosquito day has both: average relative humidity of 42% or higher; and daily minimum and maximum temperatures between 50–95°F (see Methodology). Climate Central tallied mosquito days each year since 1979 for 242 locations across the contiguous U.S. As the U.S. haswarmed over the last 43 years, the annual number of mosquito days has increased in many places. The 242 locations included in Climate Central’s analysis spannine major regionsof the contiguous U.S. Grouping these locations by region, those that experience the most mosquito days each year, on average, are: From 1979 to 2022, 173 locations (71% of the 242 analyzed) experienced an increase in annual mosquito days—by about 16 days on average. In 55 locations, annual mosquito days increased by 21 days or more. Of these 55 locations, the majority (60%) were in either the Ohio Valley (18 locations) or the Northeast (15 locations). The 10 locations that saw the biggest increase in mosquito days since 1979 were: Most of the 61 locations that experienced a decrease in mosquito days since 1979 are in the South, where summer temperatures mayfrequently exceedthe upper range (95°F) for suitable mosquito conditions in this analysis. Asspringandfalltemperatures warm, mosquitoes can emerge earlier and survive later into the year. More mosquito days mean more opportunities for mosquitoes to bite people and potentially transmit disease. But mosquito days aren’t the only factor. Mosquito activity is influenced by conditions including: Temperature:Like other “cold-blooded” ectotherms, the geographic range and seasonal activity of mosquitoes is largely controlled by ambient temperature, especially minimum temperatures. Humidity:Warmer temperatures cause more moisture to evaporate into the air, promoting the humid conditions that support mosquitoes. Rainfall:Storms, heavy rainfall, andfloodingresult in stagnant water pools that provide breeding and growing grounds for mosquitoes. Drought:West Nile virus cases in the U.S. have beenlinked to drought, possibly due tocloser contactbetween birds (virus hosts) and mosquitoes (virus vectors) around scarce freshwater resources. These weather and climate conditions interact with many other factors to influence mosquito range, activity, and disease transmission to humans. These other factors include: the thermal tolerance of viruses and other pathogens, the ability of mosquitoes toadapt to temperature extremes, frequency of human exposure to mosquitoes, land cover, and preventative public health measures. Ultimately, the risk of mosquito-borne diseases transferring to humans (the focus of a2018 analysisfrom Climate Central) is complex, and not all mosquitoes transmit disease to humans. There are more than200 speciesof mosquitoes in the continental U.S., most of which are pesky but relatively harmless. About a dozen mosquito species found in the U.S. spread viruses and parasites to people, however. The most common of these are: Culexspecies (which carryWest Nile virus, the leading mosquito-borne disease in the U.S.) Aedesspecies (which carrychikungunya,dengue, andZikaviruses). Rates of infection and the severity of resulting health effects are much lower in the U.S. than in tropical and subtropical regions. About half of the global population is at risk ofmalariaordengue, which can be life-threatening in the absence of effective prevention and treatment. The global burden of these diseases falls disproportionately in Africa and Asia. There are relatively few cases of mosquito-borne diseases compared to other insect-borne diseases in the U.S., most of which are carried byticks. West Nile virus is themost commonmosquito-borne disease in the U.S. It is spread by severalCulexmosquito species, which havewidespread suitable habitatsacross the U.S. Compared to tick-borneLymedisease, reported cases ofWest Nile virusare more widespread across the U.S., and highest in the Plains and Central U.S. Click hereto read Climate Central's report,U.S. Faces a Rise in Mosquito ""Disease Danger Days'(2018) Use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’sArboNET maptool to find county-level data on annual rates of various mosquito-borne diseases (including West Nile virus, dengue, and Zika) from 2003 through 2022. The CDC also providesmaps of estimated rangesofAedesspecies for U.S. states and Tribal lands. Under future warming scenarios, the projected annual number of West Nile neuroinvasive disease cases across the contiguous U.S. couldapproximately doubleby 2050 from 1995 levels, with the largest projected increases in the South and Southeast. Arecent reportfrom the Environmental Protection agency reviews the particular West Nile virus risks faced by children in the U.S. Although dengue is not currently common in most of the U.S. (with the exception ofFlorida and Puerto Rico), the season length for dengue transmission byAedes aegyptimosquitoes and its contagiousness have increased by48% and 64%, respectively, since the 1950s. With continued high rates of carbon pollution and warming, the potential forA. aegyptito transmit dengue is projected toexpand into temperateNorth America. Even under more moderate future warming scenarios, significant dengue risk expansion is projected throughoutGulf Coast statesby 2080. The range of disease-carryingAedesspecies of mosquitoes hasexpandedin the decades since they were introduced to the U.S. Continuedrange expansion is projectedfrom the South and Southeast into the Ohio Valley, Upper Midwest, and up the East Coast by 2050.

To explore growing wildfire risks across the U.S., Climate Central analyzed historical trends in fire weather—the combination of high heat, low humidity, and strong winds. This analysis includes data from 476 weather stations to assess trends in 245 climate divisions spanning the contiguous states during a 50-year period (1973-2022). Results show that wildfire seasons are lengthening and intensifying, particularly during spring and summer in the West. Parts of Southern California and the Southwest are seeing around two additional months of fire weather compared to the early 1970s. Annual fire weather days are also increasing in many parts of the East, although by fewer days on average than in the West. But even these smaller increases can be impactful in the densely populated East, where more people and property could be exposed. Seasonal trends are emerging in the East, with many areas experiencing more fire weather days during spring. Significant differences in climate, topography, land use, and population distribution mean that wildfire risks are regionally distinct. But fire weather isn’t limited to the western U.S. As this analysis demonstrates, all U.S. regions experience conditions that increase the likelihood of more extreme fires. As fire weather occurs more frequently, communities across the country must adapt to living with more frequent fire weather and the associated risks.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fire-weather-2023,Burning Hot: 50 Years of Fire Weather Across the United States,"May 24, 2023","Climate Central examined historical trends in fire weather—a combination of low humidity, high heat, and strong winds—across the U.S. This analysis uses data from 476 weather stations to assess trends in 245 climate divisions spanning all 48 contiguous U.S. states over a 50-year period (1973-2022). Wildfire seasons are lengthening and intensifying, particularly in the West. Many parts of the East have seen smaller but impactful increases in fire weather. Even small increases in fire weather in the East, which has nearly 28 million homes located in zones prone to burn, puts more people at risk. Climate Central’s new report,Wildfire Weather: Analyzing the 50-year shift across America, expands on wildfire risks and adaptation across the country. Download local dataRead the full report Climate change is affecting weather conditions in ways that increase wildfire risks. Warming temperatures and increasingly dry air, vegetation, and soils make it easier for fires to spread, and more difficult to fight or prevent. Fire weatherrefers to meteorological conditions that promote the spread of wildfires. Climate Central’s analysis focuses on three conditions fundamental to fire weather: relative humidity, temperature, and wind. Whenrelative humiditylevels are very low, the air pulls moisture from the land, leaving vegetation dry and prone to burning. This analysis shows decreasing relative humidity has been a major factor in boosting annual fire weather days for many locations across the U.S. Hotter temperatureshave a direct influence on fire behavior, heating the fuels and making them more likely to ignite. Fire weather conditions also restrict firefighters’ ability to put out wildfires. Climate change is causingwarmer nighttime temperatures, which decreases the overnight relative humidity that once helped firefighters gain control over wildfires. Windsupplies oxygen to a fire, causing it to burn more rapidly. Wind increases evaporation, drying out the land. Wind also carries embers, which helps fires spread. The full reportWildfire Weather: Analyzing the 50-year shift across Americadiscusses other key factors that influence wildfire, including fuels (like dried vegetation or downed trees), other weather conditions, and human activity. To investigate trends in fire weather, a key factor of wildfire risk, Climate Central analyzed data from 476 weather stations to assess trends in 245 climate divisions spanning the 48 contiguous U.S. states during the last 50 years (1973-2022). The contiguous U.S. is 2.5°Fwarmer todaythan it was in 1970. Warming that influences fire weather has been observed across the country. But key regional climate differences spanning from the West to the East result in distinct fire weather trends. As this analysis demonstrates, fire weather isn’t limited to the western U.S.—all regions experience conditions that increase the likelihood of more intense wildfires. Although the findings are divided into broad geographic regions (West and East) these two groups are comprised of multiple climate regions and climate divisions, as defined by NOAA’sNational Centers for Environmental Information. Note: the NCEI South region was split into the western South (Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) and eastern South (Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) and grouped as indicated in the tables below. Southern California, Texas, and New Mexico have experienced some of the greatest increases in fire weather days each year, with some areas now seeing around two more months of fire weather compared to a half century ago. Some places, including parts of Texas, California, Oregon, and Washington, are experiencing fire weather more than twice as often now than in the early 1970s. Western interior regions saw greater increases in fire weather compared to western coastal regions, where higher humidity levels mean these areas are less likely to reach the low relative humidity threshold used in the analysis. By contrast, parts of Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota have experienced a decline in the frequency of fire weather days. The Dakotas are part of a region wheresprings have been cooling slightly—likely a temporary trend influenced by the cooling effects ofagricultural development. Generally, the West has seen the greatest jump in fire weather days in the summer (particularly in the Southwest). A band stretching from coastal Maine through the Northeast and Piedmont Valley and into northern Florida experiences the highest average number of annual fire weather days in the East. Parts of the Southeast experience several weeks of fire weather on average each year. Northern Florida experiences around a month. The analysis shows relatively modest changes to the average number of fire weather days in the East since the 1970s. The humid heat that’s typical in the East makes extremely dry days less common, and likely dampens fire weather trends. Parts of the Southeast and Northeast have experienced some of the greatest increases in annual fire weather days across the East. Most eastern areas included in this analysis saw, at most, a few more days of fire weather since 1973—and around 20% of eastern climate divisions saw either no change or a decrease. New England has seen a decrease in annual fire weather days, driven largely by fewer days where the wind speed variable hit the analytical threshold.Slowing wind speedscould be partially attributed to a decrease in the temperature gradient between land and sea along the Gulf of Maine, assea surface temperatures have warmed drasticallydue to climate change. Across much of the region, the greatest increase in fire weather days is happening in the spring months, which aligns withspring warming trends. Expanding human developmentin forests, forest edges, and other areas where fires are prone to burn—known as thewildland urban interface(WUI)—puts more people in harm’s way. Three of the topstateswith the greatest number of households in the WUI also saw an increase in fire weather days during the period of Climate Central’s analysis: California, Texas, and North Carolina. California contains the most households in the WUI (5.1 million) of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. But most of the WUI is concentrated in the East—nearly 80% of WUI lands as well as more than 60% of WUI housing is in eastern states. The Southeast alone has around 10.6 million households in the WUI. In addition to increasing the risk of fire, more frequent fire weather conditions are causing problems even when fires don’t ignite. The same weather variables that influence fire weather are factors in determining the safe application ofprescribed fire—an important fuel-reducing forest management activity. More fire weather days meanfewer windows to conduct prescribed burning, leaving fuels like dried leaves, grasses, and downed trees to build up on the landscape. In response to high-risk fire weather conditions, and in the hopes of avoiding equipment-related ignitions, power companies in the West are shutting off electricity to millions of people duringpublic safety power shutoffs.

Graphics showing annual fire weather day trends from 1973–2022 for 176U.S. climate divisionsare organized by respective media market locations and available to downloadhere. This analysis defines a “fire weather day” as one where the following three conditions co-occur in at least two hourly measurements: Relative humidity within 5% of regional thresholds defined by NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center (based on predominant fuel type and local climate) Temperature of at least 45-55°F, depending on the season (winter: 45°F; summer: 55°F; spring and fall: 50°F) Sustained wind speeds of 15 mph or greater (10 mph or greater for Florida locations) Hourly observations for 476 stations across the contiguous United States were obtained from 1973-2022 usingNOAA/NCEI’s Local Climatological Data. Stations needed to pass several data completeness checks in order to be included in this analysis. Using the thresholds detailed above, Climate Central calculated the number of annual and seasonal fire weather days at each station over the past 50 years. Thresholds were not available for Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and therefore these locations were not included in this analysis. Results were mapped to each station’s climate division. For climate divisions with multiple stations, data were averaged across all stations. Additionally, we calculated the average annual and seasonal fire weather days and used linear regression to calculate the total change. Data were rounded to the nearest whole day. Some climate divisions only had one weather station inside its boundary. While confidence in our results increase with additional stations, our results are consistent with recent findings (for example,hereandhere).

When temperatures climb above the local minimum mortality temperature (MMT), the health risks also rise. Climate Central analyzed the change in annual days above the local MMT in 247 U.S. locations from 1970 to 2022. 232 locations have seen the annual number of risky heat days increase—by 21 more days on average since 1970. The South and Southeast were risky heat hotspots, but increases in days above local MMT were observed in every U.S. region Download local data As average temperatures warm across the U.S. and the globe,extreme heat occurs more often. More frequent extreme heatis not only an indicator of climate change—it’s also one of the most serious health risks in our warming climate. Extreme heat is thedeadliest natural hazardin the U.S. Arecent studyestimates that extreme heat accounted for 12,000 premature deaths in the contiguous U.S. from 2000 to 2010. One indicator of the local links between temperature and mortality is calledminimum mortality temperature (MMT). A location’s MMT is the daily average temperature at which the risk of heat-related death is lowest. The relative risks of heat-related illness and mortalityincrease steeplyas temperatures climb above the local MMT. A location’s MMT is generally near the hottest end of a location’s temperature distribution. Different cities have different MMTs, reflecting that these health-related heat thresholds vary based on the local climate and related long-term adaptation among local populations. For example, the MMT in Anchorage, Alaska (59°F) is lower than in Austin, Texas (87°F) because in warmer climates like Austin, locals are generally accustomed to warmer temperatures, and adaptation measures to reduce heat-related risks (e.g., air conditioned buildings) are more widespread. Climate Central analyzed the annual number of days with average temperatures above the local MMT in 247 U.S. locations, from 1970 to 2022. The following results summarize trends for 244 locations (see Methodology). The local MMT (the temperature above which heat-related health risks increase sharply) ranges across the locations analyzed—from 57°F in Juneau, Alaska, to 96°F in Phoenix, Ariz. From 1970 to 2022, 232 locations (95% of the 244 locations) experienced an increase in the annual number of risky heat days (days above the local MMT). On average, these 232 locations now experience 21 more days above their local MMT annually than in 1970. Increases in risky heat days were widespread, but 22 locations experienced an increase of 40 or more days above their MMT during the study period. Of these 22 locations: over two-thirds were in either Texas (nine locations) or Florida (six locations). 91% (20 of the 22 locations) were in the South or Southeast. The top 10 increases in annual days above MMT from 1970 to 2022 were in: Not just a southern story.Although the South and Southeast were risky heat hotspots in this analysis, it’s important to note that increases in days above local MMT were observed in every region of the U.S. The widespread rise in risky heat days since 1970 is an indicator of the heat-related health impacts already being felt in the U.S. and beyond. Warming from human activities already accounts for over one-third of heat-related deaths in 732 locations across 43 countries in recent decades (1991–2018), according to arecent study. Climate Central’sExtreme Weather Toolkit: Extreme Heatincludes more resources on the links between climate change and heat extremes. In the U.S., NOAA’s latestsummer 2023 temperature outlook(issued on April 20) indicates a high likelihood of above-normal temperatures across the South, Southeast, and along the East Coast. Furthermore, NOAA has issued a62% chance of El Niño developingduring May-July 2023, which could boost warm-season temperature extremes in the coming months. NOAA’s next outlook will be issued on May 11. A Climate Matters brief,El Niño and La Niña: Local and global effects, provides context. Extreme heat can affect everyone, but some face greater risks of heat-related illness and mortality than others. Children, adults over 65, pregnant people, and people living with illness areparticularly susceptibleto heat-related illness. Outdoor workers and athletes are also atelevated riskdue to work- and recreation-related exposure to extreme heat. Structural inequities can also lead to higher extreme heat exposure in some communities. For example, in 169 of the largest U.S. urban areas, people of color and people living below the poverty line are disproportionately exposed to urban heat island intensity, according toa recent study. Costly adaptation strategies that can reduce the risks of extreme heat (for example,household air conditioning) also aren’t equally available to everyone. Continued carbon pollution and future warming would likely worsen the unequal burdens of extreme heat. A 2021EPA analysisfound that, across 49 U.S. cities, low-income and Black individuals are 11% and 40%, respectively, more likely to currently live in areas that are projected to experience the most extreme future increases in heat-related mortality.

And 140 locations now experience at least two more weeks of above-normal summer days than in 1970. Locations in the West, Southwest, Northwest, and western Texas have seen the most summer heating. Hotter summers lead to heat-related illness and worsen air quality—putting people at risk.

Summer temperatures arrived early this year across the northwestern U.S. and western Canada in a record-breaking May heatwave that brought temperatures not typically experienced until July or August. Temperatures in parts of the western U.S. and Canada reachedClimate Shift Index™levels of 2 to 5 —indicating that human-caused climate change made this excessive heattwo to five times more likely. As carbon pollution traps more heat in Earth’s atmosphere, the summer season is warming, summer temperatures are arriving earlier in the year, and risky heat extremes are becoming more frequent. Climate Central analyzed the last 53 years (1970–2022) of summer (June, July, and August) temperature data in 247 U.S. locations. Summaries of the findings below are based on 241 of the locations analyzed (see Methodology): Since 1970, average summer temperatures have increased in 229 (95%) of the locations analyzed. Summers warmed by 2.4°F on average across these 229 locations. One-third (75) of these locations warmed by 3°F or more since 1970. The top five summer warming locations were: Reno, Nev. (11.1°F); Boise, Idaho (5.8°F); Las Vegas, Nev. (5.8°F); Salt Lake City, Utah (5.5°F); and El Paso, Texas (5.3°F). Every climate division across the contiguous U.S. has experienced summer heating. Summers have warmed the most across the West, Southwest, Northwest, and western Texas. Since 1970, 231 (96%) of the locations analyzed have seen an increase in the annual number of days above their 1991–2020 summer normal temperature. More than half of all locations analyzed (140, or 58%) now experienceat least two more weeksof above-normal summer days than in 1970. And 40 locations now experience30 or more summer daysabove normal. The top 10 locations—with between 43 and 66 more with summer days above normal—were in Nevada, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. More frequent extreme heatis not only an indicator of climate change—it’s also one of the most serious health risks in our warming climate. Excessive heat is theleading causeof weather-related deaths in the U.S. Climate change is making bouts of deadly heat longer and more frequent. Exposure to extreme heat makes it difficult for our bodies to cool off, resulting inheat-related illnessesincluding heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and even fatal medical emergencies such as heat stroke. Summer heat can alsoworsen air qualityby trapping harmful pollutants close to the Earth’s surface. These pollutants can exacerbate respiratory health issues in people with asthma and other lung diseases. And as our climate warms, risky heat arrives earlier and lingers later. A recent Climate Central analysis found that 232 U.S. locations have seen the year-roundfrequency of risky heat days increase—by 21 more days on average since 1970.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/as-floodwaters-receded-poisonous-mold-flourished-in-nj-homes,"As floodwaters receded, poisonous mold flourished in NJ homes","June 2, 2023","By Michael Sol Warren (NJ Spotlight),John Upton (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between NJ Spotlight News and Climate Central. It wasn’t until last spring that Charlene Dionio’s father was hospitalized by poisonous after-effects of Hurricane Ida, which swept from Louisiana through New England the previous fall, killing more than 100 in the United States, including 29 in New Jersey. “I underestimated the Ida storm,” Dionio said. She lives on a hill in Bergen County’s Dumont, with her daughter and dad and was surprised when her basement flooded. After an arduous cleanup, she began to notice spots in the basement carpet. “I opened the closet, and there’s black spots going up, and I said, ‘Oh my gosh.’ So now I know there’s mold,” said Dionio, who works as a nurse at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center. As pollution traps heat, storms are growing more ferocious and the intensity of rainfall is increasing, fostering more mold. Mold — or mildew — is a term describing forms of fungi that can flourish inside homes in damp conditions. Toxins released by mold can contaminate food. They can cause allergic reactions when inhaled and are most dangerous to children and the elderly, and to those with asthma and other lung conditions. Sometimes, the fungi themselves cause infections. Dionio’s father suffers from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and after catching COVID-19 in 2020 his dementia worsened. “He’s not the same anymore,” Dionio said. Despite trying to prevent him from using the mold-infested bathroom in the basement, her father would forget and use it anyway, exposing him to the poisons secreted by the microorganisms. While Dionio and her daughter experienced allergic reactions, she blames the mold for landing her father back in the hospital for three days, unable to breathe properly. “We’re healthy and we started having symptoms,” Dionio said. “When he’s exposed, when he inhales it, with his age and his condition, it will just balloon or mushroom into something that he cannot tolerate.” Mold infestations can follow undetected leaks in seemingly safe homes, and they can also follow floods from disastrous storms. As pollution traps heat, storms are growing more ferocious and the intensity of rainfall is increasing, fostering more mold. For those living near shores and estuaries, coastal flooding is occurring more frequently as seas rise. State authorities warned of this risk in 2020, when the Department of Environmental Protection released its“Scientific Report on Climate Change.”That report cites the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy as a prime example of how storm surges and heavy rains can set the stage for outbreaks of mold. “The conditions the storm created were ideal for numerous molds and bacteria,” the report reads. “Power loss rendered heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems useless, making it difficult for many buildings to maintain indoor temperature, humidity and keep up ventilation, filtration and circulation.” Dionio’s Dumont home was within a roughly 25-mile band from southeastern Pennsylvania to the greater New York City area that experienced Ida’s most intense rainfall. The storm lifted warm Atlantic Ocean waters and dumped them inland as rain as it moved north past the Appalachians. Mold infestations can be costly to remove, adding to domestic financial crises following disasters and causing health problems for those who can’t afford the high remediation costs — or whose landlords refuse to pay for fixes. New Jersey State Climatologist David Robinson said that within that narrow band, 6 to 9 inches of rain fell within six hours, causing flash flooding so severe that people drowned in basement apartments and vehicles. Although climate change is intensifying storms and escalating the intensity of rainfall, Robinson predominantly blames a confluence of meteorological and geographical factors for Ida’s destructiveness. “It was a matter of that much rain in a six-hour interval that put a lot of water in places that wouldn’t have gotten it if it had fallen at a slower rate,” Robinson said. “And it happened to fall in a very inhabited area.” Experts caution that dangers from mold are often underestimated by researchers and other experts, even as the effects of heat-trapping pollution give it a leg up in blooming inside homes. “With climate change and the number of really devastating storms going up, we’re going to be seeing more and more flooding, more and more mold growth and more and more people getting sick,” said Joan Bennett, a distinguished professor in Rutgers University’s plant pathology department. Bennett trained as a fungal geneticist and began studying chemicals known as volatile organic compounds that are released by indoor mold after her home in New Orleans was flooded by Hurricane Katrina. Mold grew on prized books and other possessions, destroying them. “There’s a saying among those of us who work with mold — ‘just add water,’” Bennett said. “There are so many mold spores in the air that basically when things get wet — almost anything, paper, rugs, food — it’s likely that mold will grow.” Mold infestations can be costly to remove, adding to domestic financial crises following disasters and causing health problems for those who can’t afford the high remediation costs — or whose landlords refuse to pay for fixes. After Ida inundated the Bridgewater basement of Alyssa Geibel and her husband with 3 inches of water, they immediately tore out the carpet and threw away soggy documents, artwork and other possessions, but it wasn’t enough to head off a mold infestation. The couple paid contractors roughly $6,000 to remediate the mold, a hefty bill that her parents helped pay. “They did a fabulous job,” Geibel said. “Our basement now is fine, and safe to be in.” Mike Van Dyke, an industrial hygienist at the Colorado School of Public Health who has researched mold and its health effects, said removing water and soggy furniture and other items immediately after a flood can reduce the likelihood of a mold breakout. “If we get the house dried out in 24 to 48 hours, there’s a lot less chance of a long-term problem,” Van Dyke said, noting that isn’t always possible. “You have these homes where people can’t get in them for a long time, so by the time they come back to the home, even three or four days later, that house is pretty well overgrown with mold.” Van Dyke and Bennett both say research into the health effects of mold is lacking, even as climate pollution amplifies the dangers that it poses. “Clearly, this is a climate issue,” Van Dyke said. “It gets a bit controversial, but I think what everybody can agree on is that mold can cause things like upper respiratory irritation; it could make asthma symptoms worse. It can cause breathing problems for those who have reduced lung function. And, in general, in those who are allergic, make allergies worse.” Van Dyke said clues that mold has taken hold inside a home include telltale odors and the dark dots and stains it produces on surfaces. “We’ve all been in a damp basement, we know what a damp basement smells like,” Van Dyke said. “When you go into a damp basement, you’re actually smelling mold, or, more specifically, the chemicals that mold produces.” --Raina DeFonza of Climate Central contributed reporting to this story.",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/report/solutions-brief-ocean-carbon,Solutions Brief: Ocean Carbon,,"Oceans regulate the global climate and keep heat-trapping gases out of the atmosphere. But human-caused warming and continued carbon pollution put tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and natural processes that move carbon from the air to the depths of the ocean for long-term storage. Humans can support and protect marine ecosystems that pull heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air and store it in the ocean. Emerging technologies could enhance or modify the ocean’s capacity for carbon capture. Restoring and protecting our oceans is not only a climate solution—it can also build climate resilience, support coastal economies, and preserve biodiversity. But these solutions are not enough to slow global warming on their own; they must be paired with deep and rapid cuts to carbon pollution. This research brief explains the ocean carbon cycle and summarizes some of the ways humans can bolster the ocean’s capacity as a climate solution. See full report",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/world-oceans-day-2023,World Oceans Day,"June 7, 2023","World Oceans Day is June 8. Oceans play a key role in livelihoods, food supplies, and climate. Oceans remove roughly 26% of the CO2 from burning fossil fuels and store it in marine life, seawaters, and on the seafloor—as described in Climate Central’s new report,Ocean Carbon. But human-caused warming and continued carbon pollution put tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and processes that remove and hold carbon long term. Restoring and protecting oceans can be a climate solution, but must be paired with deep and rapid cuts to carbon pollution. World Oceans Day,onJune 8, is a time to recognize how the ocean supports humans and protects our warming planet. Oceans cover roughly 70% of the planet and affect everyone on Earth, regardless of how far we live from the coast. Oceansinfluence global climate, support the livelihoods of millions of people around the world, andprovide food and nutrition for billions. Oceans also absorb around90% of the extra heatcaused by carbon pollution and removeabout 26%of the CO2 released by humans each year from burning fossil fuels. Oceans store around45 times more carbon than the atmosphereand12 times more than ecosystems on land—making oceans the planet’s largest source of carbon storage, capable of capturing and holding billions of tons of carbon for long periods of time. How long carbon is stored in the ocean depends primarily onhow deep it sinks. Carbon can be stored short-term (months or years) in shallower waters, but carbon transported to deep ocean waters can potentially stay out of the atmosphere for centuries. If carbon sinks even deeper to the seafloor, it could be locked into sediments for millennia. Climate Central’s new reportOcean Carbonprovides a more detailed overview of the ocean carbon cycle and how ocean carbon is stored in both living and nonliving parts of coastal and marine ecosystems, including: Coastal habitatsHealthy, intact coastal ecosystems—includingmangroves, seagrass meadows, and saltmarshes—have tremendous potential for carbon storage in soils, sediment, and plant biomass. Marine waters—shallow to deepThe vast majority of ocean carbon is stored in the water as a dissolved gas. Marine life—from microscopic to megafaunaNear the sea surface, tiny plant-like organisms calledphytoplanktonconvert CO2 intoorganic carbon(carbon that is incorporated into life forms) during photosynthesis.Phytoplankton are the base of a vastmarine food web. The zooplankton, small fish, and other sea life that feed on phytoplankton are consumed by bigger predatory fish and whales. This organic carbon is stored in thebiomassof marine life along the food chain.Whalesare unique links in the ocean carbon cycle because they move nutrients vast distances and contain huge amounts of carbon in their bodies over a lifespan of many decades. In addition to being stored in living marine organisms, carbon in the ocean can take another pathway: it can sink. From decaying microscopic phytoplankton cells to the carcasses of large whales, carbon is transferred to the deep ocean when biomass sinks. Marine sediments and the seafloorCarbon that makes its way to depths of the ocean can potentially belocked away for millennia. Over millions of years, deposits on the seafloor are compressed into rock formations for carbon storage on geologic timescales. As humanspump more carbon pollutioninto the atmosphere,primarily through burning fossil fuels, we disrupt the planet’s carbon cycle—of which the oceans are an important part. Record levelsof atmospheric CO2 mean that more CO2 is absorbed into the ocean, causingocean acidification—a fundamental change in seawater chemistry that affects marine life. Warming ocean temperatures driven by climate change are agrowing threat to fisheries on both coasts. The warmest year on record for oceans was 2022, and ocean temperatures continue to break records in 2023.April 2023experienced the second-highest recorded global ocean temperatures, and the highest for any April on record. Oceans face other pressures from human activity that impact their health, biodiversity, and ability to store and sequester carbon, including:unsustainable fishing and harvesting practices; unchecked coastal development; andmarine pollution. Reducing pressures from human-caused warming and other activities can help marine ecosystems weather some of the effects of climate change—up to a point. When paired withdeep cuts to emissions,the conservation and restoration of ocean ecosystems can bolster the ocean’s carbon storage capacity. There are many ways that humans can restore, protect, and better manageblue carbon—a term for carbon captured by coastal and marine ecosystems. These solutions can range from sustainable management of fisheries and restoration of whale populations, to conservation ofcoastalandmarinehabitats. There are alsoemerging approachesthat aim to enhance the ocean’s capacity to remove CO2. Often categorized as geoengineering, these approaches may hold promise, but research into most is nascent. Climate Central’s reportOcean Carbonbriefly describes a few of these approaches. More detailed information about ocean-based CO2 removal research and technology can be found in a 2022 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine:A Research Strategy for Ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal and Sequestration.

The analysis shows that younger generations (Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha) across the U.S. could experience between 6 to 7°F of warming over their lifetimes if high levels of emissions continue. These levels of warming would bring rapid change andmore extreme eventssuch as heat waves. The sameClimate Central analysisalso shows the powerful effects of the choices we make now. The data show that keeping global warming under 2°C (3.6°F) with rapid cuts in carbon pollution would set younger generations on a radically different path—toward a far safer future with less warming and fewer risky extreme events. The tools we need to choose this safer, cooler future are already available.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index-alert/csi-india-june-2023,Analysis: India’s fatal sweltering heat in June linked to climate change,"June 22, 2023","June 22, 2023 New analysis by Climate Central shows that a three-day extreme heat event over Uttar Pradesh from June 14-16, 2023 was made at least 2 times more likely by human-caused climate change.In Ballia, a district in Uttar Pradesh, temperatures reached 42.2°C on June 16 and at least 34 fatalities occurred over the three-day event. The analysis uses a metric calledClimate Shift Index(CSI), which quantifies the contribution of climate change to daily temperatures. CSI levels over 1 indicate a clear climate change signal, while levels between 2 and 5 mean that climate change made those temperatures between 2 and 5 times more likely. The methodology used to calculate the CSI is based onpeer-reviewed science. In addition to Uttar Pradesh, most locations across India experienced significant CSI levels during the same period. The heat wave affected hundreds of millions of people in India. In Uttar Pradesh, CSI levels peaked on June 14th, decreasing over the following two days. Certain parts of the state reached CSI levels of 3, indicating temperatures that were made at least three times more likely because of climate change. The current CSI applies only to temperature. The fact that these extreme temperatures occurred along with high humidity is unusual and contributed to the severity of the event. This extreme event comes after the deadly humid heat wave in April of 2023, which was made more than 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change. At least 34 fatalities in Uttar Pradesh were reported as part of this heat event [1] Primary and secondary schools closed in Bihar, India [2] Heat waves are amongst the deadliest natural hazards with thousands of people dying from heat-related causes each year and many more suffering other severe health and livelihood consequences. However, the full impact of a heat wave is often not known until weeks or months later, once death certificates are collected, or scientists can analyse excess deaths. As many places lack good recordkeeping of heat-related deaths, the currently available global mortality figures are likely an underestimate. While people in the affected regions are used to hot and humid temperatures, those who are more physiologically susceptible to heat (e.g. due to pre-existing conditions, age, and disability) and/or are more exposed due to their occupation (e.g. outdoor workers, farmers) are at the highest risk of heat-related health impacts. Such exposure and vulnerability are intensified by societal disadvantage based on factors such as socio-economic status, religion, caste, gender, migration, and living conditions. On top of this, factors such as air pollution, the urban heat island effect, and wildfires further compound health impacts, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. Dr. Friederike Otto, a researcher at Imperial College London and co-lead ofWorld Weather Attribution(WWA) said: “We see again and again that climate change dramatically increases the frequency and intensity of heat waves, one of the deadliest weather events that exist. Ourmost recent WWA studyhas shown that this has been recognised in India, but implementation of heat action plans is slow. It needs to be an absolute priority adaptation action everywhere.” Dr. Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at Imperial College London and WWA, said:“The combination of extreme heat and humidity is particularly dangerous for humans, even more so in urban contexts where the 'heat island' effect can further increase temperatures. Unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced, these life-threatening events will become more frequent and intense.""",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/sweltering-summer-nights-2023,Sweltering Summer Nights,"June 28, 2023","Sweltering summer nights limit our ability to cool off from scorching summer days, prolonging heat stress and related health risks. Since 1970, average summer minimum (nighttime) temperatures have warmed in 230 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central—by 3°F on average. Use Climate Central’sClimate Shift Indextool, now available inKML format, to quantify the influence of climate change on sweltering nights in your local area this summer. As our climate warms,summer is heating upacross the U.S. But summer warming isn’t all about scorching days—it’s also about sweltering nights. Summer temperatures are also rising after the sun goes down. And when nights don’t cool off enough relative to peak daytime temperatures, people also have a harder time cooling off. Sweltering nights can prolong heat stress and related health risks during the hottest time of year. Heat is thedeadliest weather-related hazardin the U.S., and warming nights worsen heat-related health risks. Summer minimum (nighttime) temperatures across the U.S. have warmed on average at a rate of1.64°F per centurysince records began in 1895. That’snearly twice as fastas the warming rate observed for average U.S.summer daytime highsover the same period. Recent summer records are consistent with this long-term trend. Average summer nights in 2021 and 2022rank as the two warmeston record for the contiguous U.S. During 2022,66%of the contiguous U.S. (by area) experienced extremely warm summer nighttime temperatures. That’s more than double the area exposed to extremely warm summer days (28%). Here, extremely warm summer nights and days are thosein the upper tenth percentileof the local summer temperature distribution over the period of record. Also in 2022,102 countiesacross the contiguous U.S. set records for hottest summer nights, while19 countiesset record summer daytime temperatures. And since the start of summer 2023 (June 1), the U.S. has already setnearly twice as many recordsfor extremely hot nights than for extremely hot days. Climate Central analyzed average summer minimum (nighttime) temperatures from 1970 to 2022 in 247 U.S. locations. Summaries below are based on 241 locations (see Methodology). Summer nights have warmed by 2.7°F across the contiguous U.S. since 1970. Since 1970, average summer minimum (nighttime) temperatures have warmed in 230 (95% of 241) U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. The average nighttime warming across these 230 locations was 3°F. Summer nights have warmed by 4°F or more in one-quarter of these 230 locations. Grouping all 241 locations byregion, the greatest summer nighttime warming has occurred across the western U.S: Southwest: summer nights warmed 3.8°F on average, across nine locations West: summer nights warmed 3.5°F on average, across 17 stations Northwest: summer nights warmed 3.5°F on average, across 16 stations Locations that experienced the most summer nighttime warming since 1970 were: Reno, Nev. (17.4°F); Las Vegas, Nev. (9.6°F); El Paso, Texas (8.2°F); Salt Lake City, Utah (7.7°F); Boise, Idaho (7.1°F); and Medford, Ore. (7.1°F). Our warming climate makesheat extremesmore frequent and intense in general—but this is happening especially at night. Warming increases evaporation from the land surface, and a warmer atmospherecan hold more of that evaporated moisture, leading to higher humidity and more cloud cover. The resulting clouds canreduce daytime warmingbyreflecting some incoming heatfrom the sun back into space. But after the sun goes down, clouds canamplify nighttime warmingby absorbing heat from the land surface andre-emitting that heatback down toward the ground. Parts of the globe that have experienced faster nighttime warming have also experiencedincreased cloud cover, specific humidity, and precipitation, likely due to theintensification of the water cyclein our warming climate. Scorching days followed by sweltering nights limit the body’s ability to efficiently cool off without costly and energy-intensive air conditioning. But according to a 2020 study, extremely hot summer days followed by extremely hot nights have becomesignificantly more frequent and intenseacross the Northern Hemisphere from 1960 to 2012, mainly due to carbon pollution. The same study found that co-occurring extremely hot summer days and nights are likely to happenfour to eight times more often by 2100(relative to 2012 levels) if moderate to very high levels of carbon pollution continue. Climate Central’sClimate Shift Indextool provides real-time estimates of the influence of carbon pollution on daily high and low temperatures across the U.S. Sweltering nights limit our ability to cool off and recover fromextremely hot summer days. This can lead to greater heat stress and relatedhealth risks—especially among people with chronic illness, young children, the elderly, outdoor workers, and otherheat-vulnerable populations. These risks compound when extremely hot days and nights occur inhistorically cooler climateswhere people are not accustomed to these events, inurban heat islands, and in neighborhoods with lower-income and more non-white residents, which facedisproportionate exposure to urban heat extremesacross the U.S. More warm nights also mean higher demand for air conditioning, which isless accessible to low-income households. A 2021 Climate Central analysis found that 235 U.S. locations have experiencedrising cooling demandssince 1970 due to rising temperatures. Higher cooling demand means higher energy bills and higher risks among households thatlack or cannot afford to run air conditioningsystems. Running air conditioners can further increase cooling demand both in the short term (as waste heatincreases outdoor air temperatures) and in the long term (due to additional carbon pollution from running arapidly-growing number of air conditionersglobally).

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/more-extremely-hot-days-2023,More Extremely Hot Days,"July 5, 2023","The frequency of extremely hot days has increased since 1970 in 195 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. About 71% (139) of these locations now experience at least 7 additional extremely hot days each year than in 1970. Extremely hot days increase the risk of heat-related illnesses and hospitalizations. Climate Central’sClimate Shift Indextool, now available inKML format, quantifies the influence of human-caused climate change on daily temperatures. In 2022, the average global temperature was2°F warmerthan the 1881–1910 baseline. Relatively small increases inaveragetemperatures cause relatively large increases inextremetemperatures. Heat is theleading causeof weather-related fatalities in the U.S. Climate change is making bouts of extreme heat more frequent and intense. As carbon pollution traps more heat in Earth’s atmosphere, the summer season is warming, summer temperatures are arriving earlier in the year, andrisky heatoccurs more often. A new Climate Central analysis looks at the changing annual frequency of extremely hot days in 247 U.S. locations during recent decades of warming. This analysis defines an extremely hot day as exceeding the 95th percentile of that location’s average maximum summer temperature rounded up to the nearest 5°F (see Methodology). The extremely hot day temperature threshold ranges across the locations analyzed—from 70°F in Juneau, Alaska to 110°F in Phoenix, Ariz. The extremely hot days threshold reflects the hottest temperatures of summer, and this analysis tallies the year round number of days above this threshold. As average temperatures rise and heat extremes occur more often, many places experience summer-like temperatures outside the summer season. Results of the analysis summarized below are based on 241 locations (see Methodology). The annual number of extremely hot days increased from 1970 to 2022 in 195 (81% of 241) locations analyzed. The average change across these 195 locations was 11 more extremely hot days now than in 1970. Nearly one-third (62) of these locations now experience at least 14 additional extremely hot days each year than in 1970. Three locations now experienceat least 30additional extremely hot days each year than in 1970: Austin, Texas: 47 more extremely hot days (above 100°F) annually San Angelo, Texas: 39 more extremely hot days (above 100°F) annually Montgomery, Ala.: 31 more extremely hot days (above 95°F) annually Climate Central’sClimate Shift Indextool quantifies the influence of human-caused climate change on daily temperatures. Now available inKML format, the Climate Shift Index uses the latest climate change attribution science to put a number on whether and to what extent carbon pollution made dailyaverageandextremetemperatures more likely. More frequent extreme heatis not only an indicator of climate change—it’s also one of the most serious health risks in our warming climate. Heat is theleading causeof weather-related deaths in the U.S. Exposure to extreme heat makes it difficult for our bodies to cool off, resulting inheat-related illnessesincluding heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and even fatal medical emergencies such as heat stroke. Summer heat can alsoworsen air qualityby trapping harmful pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants can exacerbate respiratory health issues in people with asthma and other lung diseases. And as our climate warms, risky heat arrives earlier and lingers later. A recent Climate Central analysis found that 232 U.S. locations have seen the year-roundfrequency of risky heat days increase—by 21 more days on average since 1970. Extreme heat can affect everyone, but some face greater risks of heat-related illness and mortality than others. Children, adults over 65, pregnant people, and people living with illness areparticularly vulnerableto heat-related illness. Outdoor workers and athletes are also atelevated riskdue to work- and recreation-related exposure to extreme heat. Structural inequities can also lead to higher extreme heat exposure in some communities.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/mosquitoes-spread-rare-disease-through-east-tennessee-and-theyre-more-active,"Mosquitoes spread rare disease through East Tennessee, and they’re more active","July 6, 2023","By Ben Cathey (WVLT8) and Priyanka Runwal (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between Climate Central and WVLT 8 in Knoxville. It started with severe headaches and fatigue but within a few days, Huck Zimmerman was struggling to speak clearly. He started to forget what he was saying mid-sentence and seemed loopy. “He just started really really tanking,” said Sarah Zimmerman, the teenager’s mother. “He kind of went into a hallucination state.” At the East Tennessee Children’s Hospital in September of 2019, doctors suspected and later confirmed Huck had La Crosse encephalitis—arelatively uncommon viral illnesscaused by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The virus predominantly affects children. Every year, the U.S. reports about 50 to 150 La Crosse encephalitis cases, about 10% of which were recorded in western North Carolina and East Tennessee alone, a hotspot for the disease where few are aware of its existence. “I was clueless,” said Sarah, who previously worked as a community health educator for the Knox County Health Department. “I had no clue about La Crosse.” The disease has no cure and most infections remain undiagnosed or undetected until severe symptoms occur and the patient is hospitalized. “This [La Crosse] is a virus and vector-borne disease problem that has been neglected and needs attention,” said Rebecca Trout Fryxell, a medical and veterinary entomologist at the University of Tennessee. Even as awareness about the disease among the larger public is limited, threats of being bitten by an infected mosquito are increasing as carbon pollution traps heat, warming temperatures. “The amount of time we’re exposed to mosquitoes is now lengthening,” Fryxell said. Science and news group Climate Central analyzed weather data from Knoxville going back to 1979, and found that the mosquito season has increased by 23 days since then. The specific combination of temperature and humidity that puts humans at risk of mosquito bites now occur more than six months of the year, on average. Eastern treehole mosquitoes that breed in standing water in tree cavities, discarded tires or unwashed bird baths, primarily spread the La Crosse virus. These mosquitoes feed on infected mammals like chipmunks and squirrels and transmit the virus to humans. Other stagnant water-breeding species including the invasive Asian tiger mosquito can also spread La Crosse as well as other mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis in East Tennessee. Most people who get exposed to the La Crosse virus may not show symptoms, but some—especially children under 16—could develop a severe illness due to inflammation of the brain. Symptoms appear within five to 15 days of the infected mosquito bite. “It can come on fairly suddenly with headache, fever, vomiting, just not acting right, lower energy levels,” said Joe Childs, Chief Medical Officer at the East Tennessee Children’s Hospital. In acute cases, patients can develop seizures, coma, and paralysis. In the long-term, the infection can impair neurological and cognitive functioning contributing to memory and speech issues, brain fog, and the ability to stay sharp and focus. Even after two weeks in intensive care, followed by weeks of physical and speech therapy and months of cognitive therapy, 16-year-old Huck still struggles with memorization, slow cognitive processing speed, and multitasking. “He’s at capacity trying to make it through school even with accommodations,” his mother said. She worries about him being unable to hold a part-time job or drive. The disease has no specific treatment, and doctors typically work toward managing symptoms. “Most do have a really good recovery,” Childs said. But in some cases where the brain experiences more swelling, it can take months or longer to be symptom-free, he said. Starting in the spring, Knox County public health officials set up traps to monitor mosquitoes for presence of harmful viruses. They also test mosquitoes in areas where the health department records positive human cases. To stop the insects from multiplying, they spray breeding grounds with larvicides. But resources for mosquito surveillance, management, and community education particularly for the La Crosse virus, are still limited.To fill the gap, Fryxell developed aprogramto train middle and high school students and educators in East Tennessee in mosquito collection and basic identification and to teach them about the La Crosse disease. Prevention is key, especially with a lengthening mosquito season. This includes draining standing water, using insect repellants, and wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors in mosquito-friendly areas. “Where prevention is possible that’s definitely very important,” Childs said. “You certainly don’t want to have this.”",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/changing-climate-gives-mosquitoes-more-time-to-live-each-year,Changing climate gives mosquitoes more time to live each year,"July 10, 2023","By Bill Barlow (Press of Atlantic City). Priyanka Runwal (Climate Central) contributed reporting. This is the first story in a two-part collaboration between Press of Atlantic City and Climate Central examining connections between climate change and mosquito hazards Michael “Gus” Gustray, an Atlantic County biologist, watched as helicopter blades picked up speed, blowing back the dry grass before the chopper lifted off on a search-and-destroy mission, banking over a line of trees and heading toward the wide expanse of salt marsh. The target: Tiny insects that can weigh as much as 2½ grains of table salt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the mosquito the world’s deadliest animal because the diseases they spread kill hundreds of thousands worldwide every year. In addition to that, they are very annoying. Because of the heat-trapping effects of fossil fuel emissions, they are also here longer. By analyzing temperature and humidity trends from a station at Atlantic City International Airport, science and news group Climate Central found the mosquito season here is 23 days longer on average than it was in 1979. “From what we are seeing, that’s fairly accurate,” said Doug Abdill, the superintendent of Atlantic County’s anti-mosquito efforts. “It’s not like one kind of mosquito is living longer, but there are more days in the year that are suitable for a mosquito to be alive.” In practical terms, there are now more than five months of every year on average when weather conditions in South Jersey are conducive to mosquito bites. And if West Nile virus or any of the other diseases they spread are circulating, each bite can bring a severe health risk in addition to an itchy bump. Which one is which? Patrick McGrath, an identification specialist with the Atlantic County Office of Mosquito Control, said staff members start checking water temperatures in March. When the water gets to be about 55 degrees, mosquitoes become active enough to start to breed. The most intense activity comes in June, July and August, but the mosquitoes have been around longer and longer in recent years, as shown in mosquito traps placed around the county. “We were ending up around the middle of October, when it started to get cooler. Now, we’re doing these collections longer. We’re doing them into November now,” McGrath said. He and Gustray, a biologist with the department, were in the county’s mosquito lab in the basement of a small, nondescript building at the county’s public works yard off Dolphin Avenue. There’s a flat-bottom outboard boat on a trailer outside with the Atlantic County seal and the words “mosquito control,” but no other indication that this is mosquito central for the county. McGrath had a tiny mosquito under a microscope, one of those caught in a light trap. The device looks like a well-made birdhouse, with wooden sides and a metal roof. The light attracts mosquitoes, which are then caught and contained. Gustray shows off some of the other tools, including one that uses stinky standing water in a black plastic tray. When a mosquito comes in to lay its eggs, a surprisingly gentle fan blows it into a container set above the water. Yet another trap uses dry ice to create carbon dioxide. For a mosquito, carbon dioxide is an indication that something is exhaling, and where there is breathing, there is blood. Earlier that day, Gustray watched as the helicopter took off from the open field at Stillwater Park at Shore Road. The county office does not own a helicopter but at times rents one to reach remote areas such as in the salt marsh, sometimes in cooperation with the state mosquito program. In Atlantic County, the office of mosquito control falls under the county Department of Public Works. Its job is to cut back on the mosquito population, but also to understand what mosquitoes are out there and what dangers they present. The team works with the state’s mosquito control program under the Department of Environmental Protection to watch for diseases and study mosquito populations. There are 63 different mosquito species in New Jersey, and more than 40 of those have a home in Atlantic County. When Gustray gives talks in schools or at community groups, he said, many express surprise that there are multiple species of mosquitoes. Many just assume a mosquito is a mosquito, he said. But there are complicated differences, including in what time of day they feed, where they reproduce and their preferred habitat. Some prefer salt marshes, others standing fresh water. Some like stormwater basins, while some, including the aggressive Asian tiger mosquito, which can carry West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis, can lay eggs in the water that collects at the bottom of a potted plant tray or other small container. In addition to other means of control, mosquito experts say pouring out any standing water around homes can make a noticeable difference in the mosquitoes in the air. “If we could get people to understand the habitats, and just how little water they need to breed in, I don’t think we would have the amount of problems,” McGrath said. After Gustray and McGrath identify the mosquitoes, they freeze some of them — mostly species most likely to carry diseases — to be sent to state labs for testing. It’s about more than heat While heat waves strike more frequently and severely now than they used to, and with humid heat becoming more common, such conditions alone don’t necessarily mean that summer skeeters will be unbearable this year. As much as warmth, mosquitoes need water, McGrath said. Not only do they need it to lay their eggs, most species of mosquitoes tend to be more active on humid days than on hot, dry ones. At Cape May County’s Mosquito Control Commission, Matt Diem, the assistant superintendent, said a drought can be extremely damaging to crops and wildlife — and to mosquito populations. “They really don’t like it when it’s very low humidity,” he said. Over the past two years, below-average rainfall kept down mosquito populations. There has been some rain recently, but Diem said it looks like this could be another dry, hot summer. “I guess the perfect storm would be warmer temperatures and a wet summer,” Diem said. Interviewed earlier, McGrath made the same point. Mosquitoes need water. “If things start to warm up earlier and we have a crazy downpour, that’s a horrible recipe,” he said. “That’s what happened this year.” While much of the year has been unusually dry, a single storm this spring dropped between 5 and 7 inches of rain as the weather warmed, fueling a mosquito outbreak. Atlantic County’s mosquito control efforts began more than a century ago, at the beginnings of organized efforts to control mosquitoes, running through the famous pesticide trucks fogging streets with a mixture of diesel fuel and DDT, to today’s efforts with integrated pest management, in which Abdill said the team seeks to control the insects with as little impact on non-target species as possible. Now, every county has its own mosquito control effort, coordinating through the state. Within that world, it’s accepted that warming temperatures are influencing what kinds of mosquitoes can thrive here and how long they will stick around. “The evidence is there. You can’t refute that,” Gustray said.",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/high-heat-index-days-2023,High Heat Index Days,"July 12, 2023","The risks of heat-related illness rise at heat index values of 90°F and above. Since 1979, the annual frequency of days with a heat index of at least 90°F has increased in 201 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central—by 10 days on average. Nearly one-quarter of these locations now experience at least 14 more annual high heat index days than in 1979. The South, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest have experienced the greatest increase in high heat index days. Health risks rise with the heat index, but serious heat-related illness is preventable. Heat is theleading causeof weather-related fatalities in the U.S. Climate change is making bouts of extreme heatmore frequent and intense. When extreme heat and high humidity occur together, the health risks multiply. In humid heat conditions, we can suffer heat stress and illness, and the consequencescan even be fatal. The dangerous effects of humid heat are reflected in rates ofheat-related illnessacross the U.S. this summer. When it comes to heat, focusing on air temperature alone misses the changes in humidity—and underestimates how our warming planet affects our health and weather extremes. Scientists and meteorologists use several different metrics of humid heat—the combination of high temperatures and humidity. Theheat indexis among the most common humid heat metrics (learn about other important metricshere). Theheat index(also known as the “apparent” or “feels like” temperature) is calculated using air temperature and relative humidity. Relative humidity, expressed as a percent, is a measure of how much water vapor the air contains compared to the maximum it could contain at a given temperature. When air temperatures approach normal body temperature (around 98°F), high relative humidity levels limit the body’s main way to cool off: sweating. The evaporation of sweat from skin cools our bodies. But as humidity rises, sweat evaporates more slowly and removes less heat from our bodies. As a result, our bodies “feel” hotter inhumid heat. Extreme levels of humid heat can overwhelm the body’s temperature control system and lead to serious and even fatalheat stress and illness. Heat index values of 90°F and higher are increasingly dangerous.At these levels, sunstroke, heat cramps, and heat exhaustion becomeincreasingly likelywith prolonged exposure or physical activity. Note thatheat index valuesreflect what our bodies feel in the shade. Exposure to direct sunlight can increase “feels like” temperatures by up to 15°F. A new Climate Central analysis found that high heat index days are becoming more frequent across the U.S. as our climate warms. Climate Central analyzed the change in the annual number of heat index days that “feel like” 90°F or higher in 239 contiguous U.S. locations from 1979 to 2022. Since 1979, the annual number of days with a heat index of 90°F or higher has increased in 201 (84%) of the 239 locations analyzed. These 201 locations now experience an average of 10 more high heat index days (at or above 90°F) compared to 1979, putting people at risk more often. Nearly one-quarter of these 201 locations now experience 14 or more high heat index days each year than in 1979. The South, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwestregionshave experienced the greatest increase in the annual number of high heat index days since 1979. The top six locations were all in the South or Southeast—specifically Texas, Florida, and Georgia: McAllen, Texas (32 more days); Miami and West Palm Beach, Fla. (30 and 27 more days, respectively); Austin, Texas (25 more days); Savannah, Ga. (25 more days); and San Angelo, Texas (24 more days). Explore Climate Central’sHeat and Hospitalizationsbrief for a closer look at how the heat index during peak heat-related hospitalizations varies across U.S. climate regions. When the heat index is high and the body cannot cool itself efficiently, a range ofheat-related illnessescan occur. Heat exhaustionsymptoms include dizziness, heavy sweating, nausea, and weakness due to prolonged or strenuous exposure to hot, humid conditions. Heat exhaustion can be treated by moving to a cooler location, and drinking water. If untreated, heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke. Heat strokeis a life-threatening condition requiring emergency medical treatment. A victim of heat stroke may experience confusion, dizziness, or become unconscious due to a rapid rise in body temperature to dangerous levels. Heat stress and related illnessesare preventablewith proper planning and preparation. Extreme heat and humid heat can affect everyone, but some face greater risks of heat-related illness and mortality. There are manyeffective ways to protect at-risk populationsfrom extreme heat.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hotter-climate-higher-cooling-demand-2023,"Hotter Climate, Higher Cooling Demand","July 19, 2023","As our climate gets hotter, cooling demand is rising quickly around the world. Annual cooling degree days—a measure of cooling demand—have increased since 1970 in 232 (97%) of the 240 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. The observed rise in cooling demand is likely to continue as the planet warms. Access to cooling is critical to ensure health and safety in our rapidly warming world. But the increased energy use needed to meet rising cooling demand can drive up emissions, strain power grids, and worsen urban heat islands. Solutions include cutting emissions to slow the rate of warming, transitioning to renewable energy supplies, and adopting high-efficiency cooling appliances such as heat pumps. As the planet warms and bothscorching daysandsweltering nightsoccur more often, more cooling is needed to keep homes, schools, offices, and hospitals at comfortable temperatures. Cooling demand is reflected in a temperature-based metric calledcooling degree days (CDD). CDD values estimate how much cooling is needed to maintain a comfortable indoor air temperature. CDD values are the difference between a location’s daily average outdoor temperature and 65°F, an engineering standard that is considered the ideal indoor temperature. For example, a day with an average temperature of 90°F has 25 CDD (90°- 65°). Daily CDD values—and therefore estimated cooling demand—are highest on the hottest days of the year. But any day over 65°F—including warm spring and fall days—has a CDD value. A location’sannualCDD value is the sum of daily CDD accumulated over the course of a calendar year. Climate Central used historical temperature data to analyze the change in annual CDD values from 1970 to 2022 in 240 U.S. locations. These trends estimate the changing local demand for energy to cool homes and buildings as the climate has warmed since 1970. Of the 240 total locations analyzed, 232 (97%) have experienced an increase in annual CDD since 1970. The largest increases in annual CDD since 1970 were in the Southwest, South, and Southeast. Theseregionsspend a much larger share of home energy budgets on air conditioning (up to 27%in Gulf Coast states) compared to the national average (12%). States that saw the largest increase in CDD since 1970 were: Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, and Florida. The locations with the largest increase in CDD were: Las Vegas, Nev.; McAllen, Texas; Phoenix, Ariz.; Reno, Nev.; El Paso, Texas; Tucson, Ariz.; and Albany, Ga. The observed rise in cooling demand since 1970 is a trend that’s likely to continue as the planet warms. In the U.S., projected changes in CDD are expected to drive a71% increasein household cooling demand by 2050, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest outlook. Commercial buildings are projected to see a30% increasein cooling demand over the same period. These large future projections are likely under-estimates because they’re based on air temperature (CDD) and therefore don’t account foradditional cooling demand due to humidity. Rising demand for cooling isn’t limited to the U.S., where90% of householdsalready have air conditioning. Globally, cooling demand is expected tomore than triple by 2050(consuming as much electricity as all of China and India today) as countries around the world heat up and gain access to air conditioning. According to aJuly 2023 study, if we overshoot the Paris Agreement’s aspirational 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming limit (likely by 2034) and the planet warms by 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels, the world would need much more cooling. The largest increases in cooling demand in a 2°C warmer world are expected in Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to indoor cooling is critical to ensure health and safety in a rapidly warming world with more frequent and intense extreme heat events. Air conditioning allows us to work and learn effectively, keeps food and medical supplies safe, and reduces the risk of heat-related illnesses. But increased energy use needed to meet accelerating cooling demand can strain electricity grids, drive up emissions, and worsen urban heat islands. Side effects of rising cooling demand include: The energy used to cool buildings currently relies heavily on fossil fuels. Without decarbonizing energy supply, more cooling therefore meanshigher carbon pollution and more warming. The growing demand for air conditioning can strain power grids. This can become dangerous, especially if a power gridfails during a heatwave. Chemicals used in air conditioning, such ashydrofluorocarbons(HFCs), are extremely powerful greenhouse gases with a global warming potential far greater than carbon dioxide.Global agreementsin place aim to phase down HFCs in the decades ahead. Air conditioners emit waste heat back outside. In a city with millions of air conditioners running and releasing waste heat into the outside air, it canincrease the urban heat island effect. Higher cooling demand means higher energy bills and higher risks among households that lack or cannot afford to run air conditioning systems. Although only 10% of U.S. households don’t have air conditioning, households that do lack air conditioningtend to be low-income. Within cities with relatively low rates of home air conditioning there are largeracial gaps in access, with Black and Hispanic households more likely than white households to lack air conditioning. The financial burdens of home cooling fall disproportionately on low-income households. A 2020reportfrom the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that 67% of low-income households nationwide face high energy burdens (spending more than 6-10% of their income on energy bills). A2022 studyfound that, due to their higher energy burden, low-income households in Arizona start using home cooling at 5° to 7°F higher outdoor temperatures than high-income households. A key solution to curb the negative effects of rising cooling demand is to transition to low-carbon energy supplies that replace fossil fuels with renewables such as solar and wind. This would allow us to stay cool without warming the planet. Renewable energy has helpedhomes and businesses in Texas meet the increased cooling demand during the region’s extreme and prolonged heat event since mid-June 2023. Specifically,wind and solar energy, of whichTexas is a top producer nationwide, have helped meet the prolonged spike in energy demand. Renewable energy generation reached a record of31,498 MWon June 28—enough to power more than 6 million homes. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas reports that1 MW could power about 200 homesduring peak demand. Adopting efficiency and electrification measures can reduce carbon emissions of single family homes by 24%, according toresearchfrom the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Replacing both an inefficient electric furnace and air conditioner with a singlehigh-efficiency heat pumpcan reduce electricity use significantly and save on energy bills.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/urban-heat-islands-2023,Urban Heat Hot Spots,"July 26, 2023","About 80% of the U.S. population lives in cities, where the urban heat island effect can worsen heat extremes. Climate Central analyzed how urban heat island intensity varies within 44 major U.S. cities that together account for nearly one-quarter of the total U.S. population. This analysis calculates theurban heat island (UHI) indexfor each census tract within a city to estimate how much hotter these areas are due to the characteristics of the built environment. Maps show urban heat hot spots within each city—whether concentrated in the urban core (e.g., Indianapolis) or sprawling across a vast developed area (e.g., Detroit). Across all 44 cities, the total population living in census tracts with an UHI index of 8°F or higher is 41 million—or about 55% of the 74 million people included in this analysis. Nine cities had at least 1 million people exposed to an UHI index of 8°F or higher—meaning that people in those census tracts feel at least 8°F more heat because of the local built environment. The average UHI index per capita was lowest in Wichita  (7.2°F) and highest in New York (9.5°F), San Francisco (8.8°F), Chicago and Miami (8.3°F), and Seattle (8.2°F). The average UHI index by area ranged from 5.8°F in Las Vegas to 8.6°F in New York. Planting street trees and installing cool roofs and pavements are among the ways to reduce local heat islands. Download data (.xlsx)to explore findings for census tracts, cities, and population exposure. Download .kml versionsof urban heat island intensity maps for each city. More than half of the global population and about80%of the U.S. population lives in cities. Urban populations tend to experience higher average temperatures and more intense heat extremes than people in less developed areas. This is because, in addition to the primary warming from carbon pollution, cities also experience an extra temperature boost due to the urban heat island effect. During extreme heat events such as this summer’s relentlessheat waves in the southern U.S., the urban heat island effect can worsen heat stress and related illness for millions, put vulnerable populations at risk, and lead to higher energy bills and strained power grids during spikes incooling demand. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “Theurban heat island effectis a measurable increase in ambient urban air temperatures resulting primarily from the replacement of vegetation with buildings, roads, and other heat-absorbing infrastructure. The heat island effect can result in significant temperature differences between rural and urban areas.” Most of the planet iswarmingdue to human-caused climate change, but the built environment in cities amplifies both average temperatures and extreme heat. Extreme heat is thedeadliest natural hazardin the U.S. Children and adults over 65 are among thosemost vulnerableto heat-related illness. Climate Central analyzed theurban heat island (UHI) indexin 18,945 census tracts comprising 44 large U.S. cities in order to understand where urban heat is most intense within each city. The combined population of all 44 cities analyzed is over 74 million—about 22% of the total U.S. population. The UHI index in this analysis is based on a study,Sangiorgio et al. (2020), that quantifies the factors that cause developed areas to heat up. Climate Central adapted the modeling approach inSangiorgio et al. (2020)using data on the distribution ofland cover typesin each city (fromgreen space to paved areas) as well as building height and population density, to estimate how urban heat island intensity varies within each of the 44 cities included in this analysis. SeeMethodologybelow for more detail. The primaryfactors that influence UHI index estimatesin this analysis are, in order of influence: albedo, percentage of green space, and population density. Other characteristics of the built environment, including the width of streets, orientation of urban canyons, and building heights have a smaller relative influence on UHI index estimates. SeeWhy it’s hotter in the citybelow to learn more about each factor. Of all these factors,albedogenerally has the largest effect on UHI index values. Albedo is the proportion of incoming sunlight (solar radiation) reflected by a surface. Roads, sidewalks, buildings, and parking lots all have low albedo, meaning that these common urban surfaces absorb more sunlight and radiate it back into the city as heat. Water bodies also have low albedo; in coastal cities, low-albedo water bodies can drive higher UHI index values—as seen in Seattle, New Orleans, and Miami among others. The UHI index values (in °F) in this analysis are estimates of how much the urban built environment boosts the temperature in a census tract. The UHI index is an estimate of theadditional heatthat local land use factors  contribute to urban areas. For example, on a 95°F day in rural northern Texas, people living or working in a downtown Dallas area with a UHI index value of 9°F would experience temperatures of at least 104°F. This analysis differs from a2021 Climate Central analysisin methodology and scope. The primary aim of this analysis is to assess how urban heat intensity varieswithin44 major U.S. cities. By contrast, the 2021 analysis determined a single average UHI index value for each of 158 U.S. cities, but did not evaluate the relative heat intensity of different areas within each city. Urban heat intensity and patterns of high heat exposure vary within and across the 44 cities analyzed. Maps of each cityreveal how different land use and urban growth patterns influence the distribution of heat hot spots across census tracts—whether concentrated in a small urban core or sprawling across a vast area. In some cities,heat intensity is concentrated in a distinct urban core. These cities have an extreme apparent contrast in UHI index values between the urban core and surrounding less-developed areas: Albuquerque, Bakersfield, Colorado Springs, Fresno, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Jose, Tulsa, and Wichita. Other cities have morediffused zones of heat intensity, with a smaller relative difference in UHI index values between census tracts in the urban core and outlying areas. These patterns are apparent in: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, and San Diego. Still other cities are dominated bysprawling heat intensity. In these cities, high UHI index values are not concentrated in a central core but rather spread across a vast developed land area: Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Memphis, Miami, Newark, New Orleans, New York City, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. UHI index values for individual census tracts ranged from 4.7°F (in Denver) to 13.2°F (in New York). The most extreme 25% of all 18,945 census tracts analyzed had UHI index values of 8.1°F and higher. In order to assess how many people live in areas with extreme UHI index values, Climate Central analyzed the total urban population living in census tracts at 8°F and above. Download datato explore population exposure at a range of other UHI index thresholds. Across all 44 cities, the total population living in census tracts with a UHI index of 8°F or higher is 41 million—orabout 55% of the 74 million peopleincluded in this analysis. In other words, the urban population included in this analysis is concentrated in census tracts with higher-than average urban heat intensity. More than two-thirds of residents in the following cities experience at least 8°F more heat due to the urban heat island effect: Detroit (86%), New York (78%), Dallas (75%), New Orleans (74%), Houston (73%), Portland (67%), San Antonio (67%), and Omaha (66%). Nine cities included in this analysis had at least 1 million people exposed to an UHI index of 8°F or higher—meaning that on a day when temperatures in a park outside the city are 90°F, it feels like 98°F or higher for at least 1 million people in the city. The UHI index values for individual census tracts were averaged by each city’s total area and population to determine average UHI index values for all 44 cities. The cities with the highest average UHI index values are distributed across the majority ofU.S. climate regions—with the exception of the Southwest and the Northern Rockies and Plains. The city-wide average UHI index by area ranged from 5.8°F in Las Vegas to 8.6°F in New York. The average UHI index per capita was lowest in Wichita (7.2°F) and highest in New York (9.5°F), San Francisco (8.8°F), Chicago and Miami (8.3°F), and Seattle (8.2°F). In 39 of the 44 cities analyzed, the population-weighted average UHI index values were higher (by 0.1 to 1.6°F) than their area-weighted average UHI index. Structural inequities can lead to higher urban heat exposure in some communities. According toa 2021 study, people of color and those living below the poverty line are disproportionately exposed to urban heat island intensity in 169 of the largest U.S. cities. Similarly, a2021 reportfrom the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that, with continued climate warming, several populations face disproportionate exposure to extreme heat in 49 major U.S. cities. The EPA found that “Black and African American individuals are 40% more likely than non-Black and non-African American individuals to live in areas with the highest projected increases in extreme temperature related mortality with 2°C of global warming.” The same analysis also found disproportionate exposure to extreme heat among low income (+11%) and Hispanic or Latino (+1%) populations relative to reference (e.g., non-low income) populations. Several key factors that drive extreme heat in cities were included in the UHI index: Miles of hard, dark surfaces absorb and then radiate heat back into cities.Albedo is the proportion of incoming sunlight (solar radiation) reflected by a surface. Of all the factors used to calculate UHI index values, albedo generally has the largest influence. Population density matters.Heat emissionscan come from many aspects of urban life including transportation, industrial facilities, and the heating and cooling of buildings. During a summer heat wave, air conditioning from urban buildingscan add 20%more heat to the outside air. Less vegetation means less evaporative cooling. Partially through a process calledevapotranspiration, plants help cool the air. Trees and plants can helpreduce peak summer temperaturesby 2-9°F in urban areas. Learn more:The Power of Urban Trees. The shape and height of buildings can impact airflow.The size and dimensions of buildingsinfluence how air moves through a city during the day, playing a large role in the trapping or dissipation of heat. There are a number of short-term and long-termsolutionsto adapt to an increasingly warmer future, and to mitigate urban heat stress and related illness. Short-term solutions are primarily about getting people out of extreme or dangerous levels of heat andensuring their health and safety. There are also ways to reduce urban heat island effects over the long-term such as: Planting trees, particularly along paved streets. Agreen roof, or rooftop garden, is a vegetative layer grown on a rooftop that can provide shade and reduce rooftop temperatures. Cool roofsare made of highly reflective (i.e., high albedo) and emissive materials that remain cooler than traditional materials, and help to reduce energy use. Cool pavementsare an alternative to conventional concrete or asphalt sidewalks and roads, which can reach peak summer temperatures of 120–150°F and radiate that heat contributing to the nighttime urban heat island effect. Cool pavements are reflective and/or permeable materials that help reduce surface temperatures. Research and development is ongoing on cool pavement types andtheir benefits and tradeoffs.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/nevada-shows-states-how-to-build-workforce-for-solar-energy-boom,Nevada shows states how to build workforce for solar energy boom,"July 27, 2023","By Kaleb Roedel (KUNR), Elizabeth Miller (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between the Mountain West News Bureau andClimate Central. Climate Central’s Joseph Giguerecontributed data reporting. In northern Nevada, east of Reno, a mountainous desert unfolds like a pop-up book. Wild horses on hillsides stand still as toys. Green-grey sagebrush paints the sandy land, which is baking under the summer sun. On a 10-acre slice of this desert, people are working to turn this sunshine into paychecks. As society phases out fossil fuels and builds huge new solar energy plants, this region is grabbing a share of that green gold rush by retraining workers for work that is spreading across the West. At this training center for the Reno branch of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, Francisco Valenzuela uses a wrench to secure brackets to a long steel tube on posts about four feet off the ground. What looks like the start of a giant erector set is the support structure common on large-scale solar farms. “The brackets, they hold the panels and we set it up,” said Valenzuela. A few years ago, Valenzuela did electrical work for a solar project not far from here – the 60-megawatt Turquoise Solar Farm. Now, he’s gaining more skills so he can land more jobs. The 43-year-old is originally from Sonora, Mexico, but lives in Reno for trade jobs in northern Nevada. He has two kids in Las Vegas and visits when work is slow. “You stay busy the whole year working,” he said. It’s good pay, too, he added, with some companies paying $20 to $30 an hour, or more. These days, clean energy infrastructure construction is booming and with that, so are solar industry jobs. Nevada has jumped to the forefront in retraining workers for jobs at large-scale solar plants, so much so that now, workers from other states are coming here for guidance. This year, more than half of all new power generation nationwide will be solar. Developers plan toinstall roughly 29 gigawattsof solar power – more than double the current record. In Nevada, planned projects this year could increase solar power by almost 1,600 megawatts. TheSolar Energy Industries Association saysabout 800,000 new workers will be needed in less than a decade. That’s to push the nation’s electricity generation from solar to 30% by 2030. Solar accounted forless than 4%last year. “Employers have a need, and they’re hiring, and the pace with which we are hiring and growing is fast,” said Cynthia Finley, who leads workforce strategies for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, or IREC. The organization says there were more than a quarter million solar workers across the country last year. But nearly half of the industry’s employers said it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants. “The biggest challenge, I think, for everyone is finding those connections to where the jobs are,” Finley said, as well as “finding the training to give you those skills and qualifications to do that job.” Nevada is taking the lead in developing that workforce for its residents. The state has the nation’s largest solar workforce on a per capita basis and ranks eighth in solar jobs, with more than 7,500 people working. That workforce grew 5% last year alone, the energy council says. Many of those workers are working in the deserts surrounding Las Vegas, says Guy Snow. He trains electricians with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for solar jobs. “I think we’re ahead of the game as far as being able to build large utility scale plants,” Snow said. “We have some of the largest plants being built around Vegas.” That includes the $1.2 billionGemini project. The 690-megawatt solar plant is being built on roughly 7,000 acres, making it the nation’s biggest. Gemini is expected to be completed by the end of the year and generate enough electricity to power 260,000 homes. “We have 300 electricians out there right now working on that solar plant,” Snow said.“I’m pretty confident we’re going to be able to handle the entire needs of the state of Nevada, for solar and storage.” Despite the economic and renewable energy benefits, projects like Gemini also can damage the environment. “We are very much in support of solar as a key to our renewable energy transition,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity. “What we do have concerns with is the current push toward developing these projects largely in intact desert habitats and undeveloped landscapes.” Donnelly says developers should build in locations that humans have already disturbed, like abandoned mines or agricultural lands. But, he adds, the biggest threat to biodiversity is climate change – and the main cause is burning fossil fuels. That means more solar farms, and a growing workforce, at least for now. Although solar jobs soar when installations are underway, at some point, those jobs will run out. Last year, almost 172,000 solar jobs were with project installation and development firms, and only around 16,000 were in operations and maintenance, according to the latestNational Solar Jobs Census. The electrical workers union is addressing that issue by making sure trainees are qualified, not just for big solar projects, but to work as general electricians on the steady stream of construction jobs around Vegas. But there have been other hiccups in the growth of solar employment. Supply chain concerns and the specter of new tariffs on solar panels temporarily slowed large-scale installations last year. The Solar Jobs Census reported a decline in utility-scale jobs, even as residential installation jobs increased. Over the longer term, however, the trend is strongly upward. If projects move ahead as planned in Nevada, solar capacity in the state will double by 2029. Back in northern Nevada, Paige Den-dekker is also getting trained on solar work. The 57-year-old journeywoman is from Montana and used to be a flagger for mining operations. But she’s seeing more and more solar opportunities, especially in Nevada. “You make better money. It’s better for the environment,” she said. “And it also creates a lot of jobs for our apprentices and everybody that’s in the laborers’ union.” The Reno branch of the laborers’ union readies an average of 25 people a month for solar assembly and installation. And sometimes a lot more, says Al DeVita, the center’s director. “Lately, a lot of people have been coming in for the solar training that we’ve been providing – and it’s a big hit,” DeVita said. “We invested a lot of money in this training because we know there’s a lot of work, and our piece of it is to try and provide a skilled workforce.” And the union is helping provide more skilled instructors nationwide. This year, laborer trainers from across the country have been coming to the Reno desert to learn the tricks of the trade. “I would say we’re way ahead of the curve,” DeVita said. “Close to 50 instructors from all around the country are coming in here to see what this site is – lots of people taking pictures, there’s a guy out there with a drone – and they’re trying to figure out how to implement it at their site.” In the meantime, trainers in the Nevada desert will keep preparing workers to power the green gold rush in the West.",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/it-could-be-a-matter-of-life-and-death-hotter-nj-nights-threaten-vulnerable,"‘It could be a matter of life and death,’ hotter NJ nights threaten vulnerable","July 29, 2023","By Joe Martucci (The Press of Atlantic City) and Patricia Martinez Sastre (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration between The Press of Atlantic City and Climate Central. PLEASANTVILLE — With air as muggy as the tropics and the low tide along Lakes Bay smelling like sulfur, Danielle Kilburn, 32, was swelling up again. “I went to the doctor. The question they always ask to see if it’s normal swelling or trending toward preeclampsia is ‘Do you wake up fine?’” Kilburn said. “And I wake up as swollen as a balloon.” Preeclampsia can pose many dangers for an unborn baby, according to the Mayo Clinic. Kilburn, who moved from Colorado last September, lives without air conditioning in her rented Pleasantville home, shared with her fiancé, young child and soon-to-be baby. She works as a math and physics tutor and is worried about the impact extreme heat could have on her newborn. “My fear is that I have about a month to have a baby and to find a way to get this house cooled down, because it could be a matter of life and death,” Kilburn said. Being exposed to extreme heat during pregnancy stresses the fetus and can lead to complications both for the mother — hypertension, gestational diabetes — and the baby, like lower birth weight, medical research shows. Also, being too warm while sleeping can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Climate change affects almost every facet of life, from our bodies to the economy, the culture and the physical landscape. Humid summers in South Jersey were always tough, but with the warming climate they’re getting tougher, with nights that are warming up and exposing the most vulnerable — like pregnant moms — to heat stress that doesn’t let up. Even in a summer that hasn’t seen much extreme heat, the hotter nights and overall warming trend have many impacts on health. To better understand how hotter summers are changing life in our communities, The Press of Atlantic City and Climate Central — a non-advocacy climate change science and news organization — teamed up for this special report. “The big problem with warmer nights is that they don’t allow people to recover,” said Tony Wolf, who researched climate change and human physiology as a postdoctoral scholar in kinesiology at Penn State University. “Heat stress places a higher demand on the normal physiological processes of the body — our heart has to pump more blood per minute in order to deliver more blood to the skin, which increases strain on the cardiovascular system,” Wolf said. “We also see increased ventilation rates during heat stress, potentially contributing to respiratory distress in some people.” If the number of extremely hot nights keeps growing, as studies predict, that increased physiological strain could add to the likelihood of health issues from heat exposure. Humidity worsens that scenario by preventing the evaporation of sweat, which normally cools the body. The combination of heat and moisture is what experts call “heat index” value. While air conditioning has made these more frequent sultry nights more tolerable, those without it face rising risk of harm during the summer. Those most at risk are the elderly with comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes, outdoor workers, children and pregnant women. Historically, the Atlantic City area has had on average three days per year with a heat index above 100, according to a 2019 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists. By midcentury, that number could increase to 22 days per year if our heat-trapping emissions aren’t reduced, and up to 47 days per year by the late century. “We’re looking at roughly a month and a half with a heat index above 100 when you might be really hot or experiencing those hot nights. That’s a long time,” said Kristina Dahl, a principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “On the other hand, if we take really bold action and we swiftly and dramatically reduce our emissions globally, we could limit that frequency of extreme heat to 14 days per year.” The trend Dahl’s group projected is already here, and it’s not just for afternoon temperatures. A long-running weather station at the Sen. Frank S. Farley State Marina in Atlantic City showed an average of only one night a year that failed to fall below 75 degrees between 1881 and 1910. Today, the average is 12 nights a year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Other stations show the same fast-rising trend in the past 30 years. Despite the growing exposure, not everyone can access air conditioning. For many residents in South Jersey — where data show large at-risk populations with a high rate of low-income families and ailments like diabetes — not everyone can afford it. At least 12% of home energy expenditures are spent on air conditioning in the “mixed-humid” climate region, which includes South Jersey, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That amounts to between $200 and $300 a year in higher utility bills. For residents with lower incomes, that extra cost is hard to cover. “I hate being sticky all damn day. I hate humidity,” said Shondalei Rodriguez, of Northfield. “However, I suffer because of the electricity bill. Like, who can even afford the bill anymore?” Rodriguez only turns on her window units during the hottest days. Kilburn has the same worries about turning on the air conditioning. “The summers are financially a really hard time for us, so I appreciate saving money. But I’d rather save in other ways,” she said. “I’d gladly spend the money on air conditioning and save it somewhere else.” And then there is the rare couple living in an oceanfront apartment in Atlantic City who choose not to have air conditioning. Zach Katzen, 44, agreed to the no-AC lifestyle at the urging of his girlfriend, Valerie Feo, 35, who sleeps under blankets even on the hottest nights. Now he spends many evenings with his face in front of a floor fan while watching television, and he takes as many as five showers a night to cool off. “Sometimes at night I will regret that choice (not to get air conditioning),” Katzen said. Heat can kill. Other weather disasters may be more spectacular, like wildfires or catastrophic storms such as Sandy and Ida, but heat is the number one killer among extreme weather events. At least 181 people died in New Jersey from heat stroke between 2000 and 2020, according to state Department of Health statistics. The worst years were 2002 and 2011, with 21 deaths each summer. Nationwide, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 600 to 700 preventable deaths per year are caused by extreme heat. But that’s only a fraction of a much more worrisome reality, because most heat-related deaths are attributed to other causes heat contributes to, such as heart attacks. “When we do more complex analyses and we try to understand how many people actually would not have died in absence of extreme heat — because of this sneaky and indirect mechanism that will exacerbate existing comorbidities — the number of deaths attributable to heat can go up between 12,000 to 20,000,” said Dr. Tarik Benharhnia, an associate professor of climate change epidemiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego. Heat also puts South Jersey residents in the hospital each summer. Among the six counties in New Jersey with the highest rates of hospitalizations for heat-related illnesses, Atlantic ranked second, Cape May third and Cumberland tied for fifth, according to data for 2016 to 2020 from the New Jersey Department of Health. There is no single temperature or heat index threshold where everyone starts to feel the effects of extreme heat. And while it affects each of us differently, generally, at a heat index of 90 degrees, vulnerable groups like outdoor workers, seniors and children start to become affected, according to climate scientists. At a heat index around 105 degrees, nearly everyone is at risk. “Yes, we can adapt physiologically to the heat,” said Wolf. “But the extent to which we can adapt, as the environment around the world continues to warm, is kind of anybody’s guess at this point.” Since records began in 1943, the mean nighttime minimum temperature between June and August has risen almost two degrees at Atlantic City International Airport, according to NOAA. The overall increase in Atlantic City has been more than five degrees since records were first taken in 1874. Across most of the U.S., since records began in 1895, nights have warmed at a rate of 1.58 degrees per century, nearly twice as fast as the warming rate observed for maximum daytime temperatures. Several factors explain why nights are hotter and, over the past several decades, tend to be warming faster than days across the U.S.. One cause relates to the varying thickness of the layer of air affected by carbon dioxide, which blankets the earth more warmly at night. Burning fossil fuels adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Another cause relates to the way a warming climate creates more clouds over land, which tend to absorb in the nighttime the heat coming back out from the surface toward the atmosphere. Our urban environment also plays a part. Especially within large metropolises, city landscapes hold in the heat, a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect, said Jennifer Vanos, an associate professor in the Global Futures Laboratory in the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University. “It’s at nighttime when all of the buildings and the concrete that have been absorbing that heat all day long start to emit it into the atmosphere,” she said. “And so then we see that the cities are not cooling off as fast as the rural areas.” Even the use of air conditioners plays a role in the problem. When in operation during nighttime hours, they continuously emit heat into their surroundings. Studies in several cities around the world have shown this can increase the mean outside air temperature about 3.5 degrees and exacerbate the urban heat island effect. “It’s like a pump that takes hot air from inside to outside,” said Benharhnia. “So of course if a lot of households do that, it will automatically increase the temperature.” Less affluent residents endure the worst health impacts of extreme summer heat. In addition to struggling with the cost of air conditioning, low-income residents tend to live in denser, hotter neighborhoods, where long-term underinvestment has provided too little shade, green space or facilities to escape the heat. In South Jersey and on the Jersey Shore, Rutgers University’s heat vulnerability index’s most severe ratings include most of Atlantic City, a section of Pleasantville — east of Main Street and between Stillwater County Park and Route 30 — much of Wildwood and the entirety of West Wildwood.

When her family moved to Pleasantville, she did not know her home would not have air conditioning. Newly purchased fans and one evaporative cooler did not work as expected. “It literally did not cool anything,” she said. “We’re slowly trying to cobble together air conditioning units and cool down one room at a time, but it is not going well. This is a two-story, three bedroom house, and it’s definitely old.” Kilburn wishes she could at least have the choice, and the money, to provide air conditioning for her loved ones. That will have to wait, despite her numerous fears. “I’m scheduled for a C-section. We are going to move (the delivery) back a week or so to give my body a break,” said Kilburn, whose newborn is expected in August.",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/climate-shift-index-global-july-2023,Fingerprints of climate change during Earth’s hottest month,"August 2, 2023","July 2023 was marked by record-shattering global average temperatures and widespread local heat extremes—which are among the deadliest weather-related hazards. Analysis using theClimate Shift Index®, Climate Central’s daily temperature attribution tool, indicates that human-caused climate change made July’s extreme heat far more likely. At least 2 billion people around the world—one-quarter of the global population—felt a very strong influence of climate change on each day in July. Those living near the equator and on small islandsexperienced the strongest influence of human-caused climate change on temperatures during July. Levels of July heat in the southern U.S., Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbeanwould have beenextremely unlikelywithout human-caused climate change. In the U.S., 244 million people—73% of the population—experienced at least one July daywith temperatures madeat least three times more likelydue to human-caused climate change. U.S. cities with the strongest climate fingerprints on July heat were:Cape Coral, Fla.; Sarasota, Fla.; Bonita Springs, Fla.; Santa Fe, N.M.; Miami, Fla.; Mesa, Ariz.; Albuquerque, N.M. Read the full report: Worldwide daily fingerprints of climate change during Earth's hottest month Download data: July Climate Shift Index (CSI) for 200 countries and 4,700 cities From July 3 through July 31,global temperatures were continuously hotterthan any prior recorded observations. The peak of the global heat occurred onJuly 6with a reading of 62.74° F (17.08°C), which was 0.50°F (0.28°C) hotter than the previous hottest day (in August 2016). This all-time record-breaking heat followed the planet’shottest June ever recorded. Heat waves are among the deadliest weather-related hazards. The rising global frequency and intensity of these devastating events is consistent withwell-established scientific understandingof the consequences of carbon pollution—mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. When it comes to specific weather events,climate change attributionuses statistical methods to quantify the influence of human-caused climate change on a particular event’s likelihood. Climate Central’s daily attribution tool, theClimate Shift Index(CSI), applies the latest peer-reviewed methodology to map the influence of climate change on temperatures across the globe, every day. The CSI is based on the relative frequency of daily temperatures in the current climate and in a world without human-caused climate change. For example, a CSI level of 3 indicates local conditions that were madeat least three times more likelydue to climate change. SeeWhat is the Climate Shift Index (CSI)?below for more information. New Climate Central analysis uses the CSI to quantify the influence of human-caused climate change on daily average temperatures experienced in 200 countries and in more than 4,700 cities across the globe, from July 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023. Read the report: Worldwide daily fingerprints of climate change during Earth's hottest month Download data: July 2023 Climate Shift Index (CSI) for 200 countries and 4,700 cities This analysis complementsrecent analysisby the World Weather Attribution initiative of July 2023 heat waves in North America, Europe, and China by considering the entire planet and by highlighting the exposure of people to heat made more likely by carbon pollution. Average CSI levels during July 2023 were especially high (CSI level 4 and 5, indicating conditions madeat least 4x and 5x more likelydue to climate change, respectively) in: north Africa (especially Algeria); the Gulf of Guinea coastline; parts of central Africa, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa; the Arabian Peninsula; the Mediterranean Basin; the Malay Archipelago; the Amazon Basin; the Andes; Central America and the Caribbean; Mexico; the southern United States; northwest Canada; and Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. During July 2023, 6.5 billion people—81% of the global population—experienced at least one day at CSI 3 or higher, and 50% experienced at least 10 days at this level. On each of the 31 days in July, at least 2 billion people felt avery stronginfluence of climate change (CSI level 3 or higher). Global exposure peaked on July 10, 2023, when 3.5 billion people worldwide experienced hot conditions that were madeat least three times more likelydue to human-caused climate change The average person on the planet experienced 11 days at CSI level 3 or higher, and eight days at level 5. In July 2023, the Southwest, South, and Southeast experienced extreme and even dangerous heat. Phoenix, Ariz. experienced a record 31 consecutive dayswith temperatures of 110°F (43.3°C) or higher, from June 30 to July 30, shattering the previous record of 18 days in June 1974. Temperatures in California’s Death Valley soared to 128°F (53.3°C) on July 16, close to the hottest air temperature ever recorded on Earth. On July 17, all-time high temperature records were setin Grand Junction, Colo. and Gallup, N.M. at 107°F (41.7°C) and 101°F (38.3°C), respectively. July 2023 heat in South Florida was historic,influenced in part byunprecedented ocean temperatures. In Miami, the heat index value surpassed 100°F (37.8°C) for arecord 46 straight daysfrom June 10 to July 26.On July 16, the National Weather Service issued the city’s first everexcessive heat warning. Recentanalysis by the World Weather Attribution initiativefound that “maximum heat like in July 2023would have been virtually impossibleto occur in the US/Mexico region if humans had not warmed the planet by burning fossil fuels.” In the U.S., July average CSI levels were especially high in:the West (Nevada and central California), throughout the Southwest, the South (especially Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi), and the Southeast (especially Florida). During July 2023, 244 million people in the U.S.—73% of the population—experienced at least one day at or above CSI level 3. These statistics include all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but do not include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. territories. Nationwide, the U.S. had a July average temperature anomaly of 1.8°F (1.0°C) and average CSI level of 0.9. But certain U.S. cities—especially in the South, Southwest, and Southeast—had especially intense and prolonged CSI signals. There were 25 U.S. cities with an average CSI level of 3 or higher in July 2023, 19 of which had at least 21 July days with CSI levels of 3 or higher: The following U.S. cities all had CSI levels of 5 (the maximum on the scale) during their most intense 14-day heat events in July 2023. CSI level 5 events would be very difficult to encounter in a world without human-caused climate change—not impossible, but extremely unlikely. In July 2023, prolonged extreme heat also impacted northern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and parts of Canada. Following therecord warmest Junein the Caribbean Islands regionand inSan Juan, Puerto Rico, extreme heat persisted in July. The Cayman Islands experienced itsall-time hottest nightwith a minimum temperature of 85.3°F (29.6°C) recorded at Owen Roberts International Airport on July 13. Temperatures swelled to 122°F (50°C) on July 14 in Mexicali,capital city of the state of Baja California in northern Mexico. Only16% of householdsin Mexico have air conditioning. Extreme heat resulted inlarge-scale crop damageand livestock lossesacross the U.S. Southwest and Northern Mexico, including corn, soybeans, coffee, sugarcane, and the death of hundreds of cattle. Canada’s Northwest Territoriessaw its hottest temperature ever reported(100.2°F, or 37.9°C) near Fort Good Hope—this after the worst start to the country’s wildfire season on record. July average CSI levels were extremely high across Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.States and countries around the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico had exceptionally strong climate fingerprints in July. This includes Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guatemala, and Mexico, as well as many Caribbean islands. A total of 14 North American countries had a July 2023 CSI of 5.0 (the maximum level on the CSI scale), indicating conditions that would be extremely unlikely without human-caused climate change. Eleven of the top 14 North American countries are Caribbeansmall island developing states. A total of 17 North American countries had at least 28 July days at CSI level 3 or higher. Global average temperatures were hotter than ever in 2023. But people don't experience global average temperatures. Instead, we mainly experience climate change through shifts in the daily temperatures and weather patterns where we live. Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index(CSI) tool quantifies the local influence of climate change on daily temperatures around the world. The CSI quantifies how much human-caused climate change has shifted the odds of daily temperatures that people experience locally. The CSI tool is grounded inpeer-reviewed attribution scienceand was launched by Climate Central in 2022. TheCSI toolis free to access. The Climate Shift Index is based on the ratio of the local frequency of a particular daily temperature in the current climate to the estimated frequency of that temperature in a world without human-caused climate change. The Climate Shift Index (CSI) has 11 levelsthat indicate how climate change has altered the frequency of daily high, low, and average temperatures at a given location. CSI levels from 1 to 5indicate that human-caused climate change has made the observed or forecasted temperatures more likely or, equivalently, more common. CSI levels from -1 to -5indicate temperatures that are becoming less likely or less common due to human-caused climate change. watch ourvideo explainer explorethe FAQson our website read ourpeer-reviewed methods paper Here are five ways to use this attribution analysis from Climate Central: Use the tools.Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index map toolshows which parts of the world are experiencing high CSI levels, every day.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/how-wetter-storms-drive-mold-related-health-issues-as-hurricane-ians,How wetter storms drive mold-related health issues as Hurricane Ian’s anniversary approaches,"August 7, 2023","By Jessica Meszaros (WUSF), John Upton (Climate Central) This story was produced through a collaboration betweenWUSFPublic Media in the greater Tampa Bay region andClimate Central, a nonadvocacy science and news group. Raina DeFonza (Climate Central) contributed science reporting. Click to hear audio Rain pounded outside as water pushed in through the baseboards. Hurricane Ian had reached Southwest Florida. Christian Childers and Kendra Elliott hunkered with their two boys, staying away from windows in the hallway of their Englewood home.""It sounded like jets constantly flying over our house,"" Elliott said. ""It was horrible. I was scared the whole time."" The danger posed to Elliott, Childers and their kids by last fall’s storm had hardly begun. The family would be shattered, but not by the original brunt of Ian. Floodwaters filled the family’s two-bedroom unit to ankle depth. ""We had a good amount of water in our house, and Christian sat there all night scooping it out,"" she said. Without power for the two weeks following, the family couldn't run air conditioning, despite extreme heat and humidity. That, combined with the pervasive dampness, produced ideal conditions for a nightmarish mold outbreak. ""The walls started to turn to muck,"" Elliott said. ""Mold just started growing."" The family sought emergency housing support but was turned down because the roof wasn’t damaged. Elliott said they couldn't afford to move because their landlord continued to demand monthly rent for the moldy Englewood unit. Elliott, a medical assistant, was even more strapped for cash as she had to skip work to stay home with one of her kids, whose school was closed for about a month after the storm. Plus, Childers, who did lawn care, was also out of work for two weeks due to flooding. Childers suffered from asthma and fell ill after the mold appeared, and he ended up in the emergency rooms a few times in three months after the storm. ""He was working in Punta Gorda, so he would be out of town for a week and be fine where he was staying for work, and come home and literally spend the weekend in the hospital,"" Elliott said. On Christmas Eve, the 26-year-old Childers went into cardiac arrest and died after about a week of unconsciousness. ""I have two boys and they're really close with their dad, and I just can't give them what he can give them, you know? It's just hard doing everything on my own now,"" Elliott said. ""On holidays, it's even worse."" Elliott said she and Childers met in 2015, while both were working at a car wash in Venice. She accepted his marriage proposal last summer. “He was very shy. Big heart. Really down-to-earth guy. Very easy to get along with. Very caring,” Elliott said. “He was perfect for me. Couldn’t have found anyone better.” There was an increase in hospital visits from neighborhoods affected by Ian, including patients sickened with symptoms associated with indoor mold, according to Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief medical officer at Lee Health, which operates hospitals and other medical services in Southwest Florida. He said patients living with mold, like Childers, were often healed and discharged only to be readmitted after returning to their homes, where they were exposed anew. ""While it's difficult for us to say specifically that these were mold-related issues, there was a correlation between individuals who were living in areas that were heavily mold affected and their need to access immediate care with our health system,"" Gonsenhauser said. There are many varieties of indoor mold — strains of fungi sometimes called mildew — and their invisible spores abound in the air. Some are more dangerous than others. No U.S. state is more vulnerable than Florida, where the climate is hot, muggy, rainy and fraught with tropical storms — a veritable fungal cornucopia. ""Florida is one of the epicenters for mold-associated issues, period,"" said Gonsenhauser. ""That's in general — including after major hurricanes and floods."" As fossil fuel pollution traps heat, it's pushing up temperatures and humidity levels, intensifying storms and rainfall rates, hoisting sea levels and thrusting storm surges higher and farther inland, according to scientists. The changes have turbocharged flooding in recent years in Florida, New York City, Vermont, St. Louis, Houston, Eastern Kentucky and Puerto Rico, destroying homes and lives and fueling outbreaks of indoor mold. When mold spores land on suitably damp material, they sprout to form mold colonies. When chemicals released by these colonies settle on food, they can be poisonous. Inhaling the chemicals can trigger symptoms reminiscent of seasonal allergies. Those most at risk are the elderly, children or people with lung diseases or immune problems. Researchers who study the health effects of indoor mold say more funding for research into the chemicals produced is desperately needed. ""Mold is one of the most serious results of water damage — it grows as quickly as 24 to 48 hours after water sets in,"" Gonsenhauser said. ""Given the preponderance of mold occurrence here in Florida, and the fact that we know it can carry with it health impacts and concerns, it is something that we're always looking for."" A tropical storm that formed in the eastern Caribbean on Sept. 23 hit western Cuba as a major hurricane four days later, where it knocked out power and killed two people. Hurricane Ian's eye passed near Punta Gorda the following day, producing a storm surge that peaked at 15 feet at Fort Myers Beach — taller than most ranch houses. ""Water was the factor making Ian uniquely destructive,"" said Daniel Noah, a federal meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ""Saltwater storm surge destroyed areas near the beach while flooding rain produced historic overland and river flooding that spread from southwest to northeast Florida."" Englewood was spared the brunt of the storm surge, but it was inundated nonetheless because of the effects of Ian's copious rainfall. Scientists have long projected that climate change would boost rainfall, because warmer atmospheres can hold more moisture. And they said warming oceans would boost hurricane winds because tropical storms draw their energy from the sea beneath them. In recent years, a field of climate science known as extreme event attribution has detected effects on rainfall during hurricanes that exceeded expectations. ""Every single hurricane we've looked at is wetter because of climate change,"" said Michael Wehner, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who has investigated how warming affected rainfall in dozens of tropical storms. He's a co-author of an unpublished paper that estimates climate change increased Ian's rainfall by about a fifth. Although research is preliminary, Wehner believes strengthening winds caused by warming oceans are helping to shake a greater percentage of the moisture out of the sky during storms. ""What's driving that increase in precipitation efficiency is the extra energy in the system,"" he said. ""As we continue to burn fossil fuels, we're just making it worse and worse. So expect more of this."" Research after Hurricane Harvey suggested the additional rainfall associated with climate change increased the number of properties flooded by that 2017 storm by a little more than a third. Wehner said such findings are not available for Ian. Building and home furnishing materials common in Florida magnify threats of indoor mold, said Naresh Kumar, a University of Miami professor whose research includes the effects of tropical storms and other disasters on indoor environmental quality and public health. Carpet and wallpaper can trap moisture and foster indoor mold growth. Mold colonies often grow in air ducts, regardless of whether there has been flooding. Drywall is cheap but can quickly turn moldy after becoming wet, unlike pricier cement board. Indoor mold infestations can lead to runny noses, sneezing, headaches, nose and throat irritation, breathing difficulties and congestion. Kumar said these allergic reactions affect each of us differently, depending on how our immune systems react to the foreign substances. ""The most important measure is controlling excess indoor humidity,"" Kumar said. ""Installing a dehumidifier can fix this issue."" Kumar’s teams of graduate students test for mold in flooded homes following tropical storms. During tests in homes flooded by Ian, he said, they detected mold in two-thirds of them. ""Unless we improve our understanding of how building material interacts with our climate or the local environment, there is no solution,"" Kumar said. ""Our building design, our air-conditioning systems that we are using here are not suited for this climate — these were suited for a colder climate."" In 2005, Joan Bennett was living in New Orleans when her home was flooded by Hurricane Katrina. As a fungal biologist, dealing with the mold that came after the flood sparked an academic interest in its health effects. Eighteen years later, Bennett is in the ""twilight"" of her career, as a distinguished professor of plant biology and pathology at Rutgers University in New Jersey. She said a lack of research funding hamstrung her efforts to better understand and communicate mold’s health risks, part of a broader problem she sees in research into indoor environmental quality. Unlike many other diseases, there's no medical test that can determine if a patient's symptoms are caused by indoor mold. There isn't even a common name for such a disease. The shortage of mold research and inability to test patients directly for mold exposure makes it harder for victims to sue landlords and file insurance claims. Medical staff in cooler and less humid states often overlook indoor mold as a source of their patients' woes, forcing patients to search for doctors who can help them and sometimes driving them to alternative medicines. Bennett said it's ""well understood"" that people with immune deficiencies can succumb to a variety of fungal diseases, that those with allergies and asthma can be affected by indoor mold, and that indoor molds produce toxins that can cause severe illnesses when they settle on food and are consumed. ""What gets more controversial is people who are not immune suppressed, or who don't have known allergies or asthma, who are exposed to indoor mold and believe that they're ill — it's not fully accepted that mold is the problem,"" Bennett said. Bennett said the compounds released by mold have been studied less extensively than those produced by sources of outdoor pollution like vehicle exhausts and power plants. ""People need to know that if they feel that they've been made sick by indoor microbial exposure, that it's not just in their heads,"" Bennett said. An autopsy of Christian Childers states that he died because of “home environmental mold exposure.” Alan Bell, the attorney representing Kendra Elliot, her sons and Childers’ mother, shared snippets of the autopsy report. Bell specializes in representing clients poisoned by mold and other sources of indoor pollution. The family’s lawsuit against the owners of the Englewood unit alleges, among other things, negligence in failing to fix the mold that sickened the family, leading to Childers' death. In preliminary court filings, lawyers for the landlords denied any wrongdoing by their clients. They did not respond to requests for comment. Bell has represented victims of indoor mold exposure across the U.S., including residents of rundown Section 8 public housing and well-to-do celebrities. He rattled off the challenges of suing over mold exposure. ""No. 1, you need the proper doctors to diagnose the illnesses as related to mold exposure,"" Bell said. ""No. 2, you need proper testing in the home that would be admissible in court to show the existence of pathogenic mold inside. And No. 3, these injuries are invisible injuries in many instances."" Elliott grew up in Florida, but after her fiancé’s death moved to Tennessee, where she said living costs are more manageable for a single mother. ""I didn't have any more options, I can only do so much,"" said Elliott, adding that she continues to receive medical care for the effects of the mold exposure. ""We weren't waking up feeling well. We were all cranky and angry. My little ones, their noses are constantly running. It just wasn't good.” More than six months after the death of her fiancé, indoor mold has forever changed her life. ""I literally had everything I ever worked for, our love, just ripped away from me,"" she said. ""I had to leave the state I was raised in. It was just horrible."" Now that Florida is in peak hurricane season and as Hurricane Ian’s first anniversary approaches, Elliott said she hopes others learn from their story about the severe dangers posed by indoor mold. ""It's not something you want to mess with,"" she said. ""But I don't know, because some people could be in my situation, where they don't have anywhere to go … it's just very hard.""",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/report/after-the-storm,"After the Storm: Damp, moldy homes","August 9, 2023","The risks from heavy rains and flooding don’t pass with the storms. Buildings exposed to flooding are left wet, damaged, and potentially harmful to health. Dampness can support the growth of mold and other organisms—contributing to poor indoor air quality and a range of potential health problems. Remedying water damage to reduce health risks is an important part of storm recovery. As flood risks increase due to climate change, more people are vulnerable to health problems from damp, moldy homes after the storm. Communities across the United States are increasingly vulnerable to damaging floods due to more intense storms and rising sea levels—all exacerbated by climate change.

Clad in wet suits and snorkel masks, Michael Freake and Jeronimo Silva wade through the cold waters of the Doe River flowing through Roan Mountain State Park. They’re in search of America’s largest salamander that spends its entire life in water, a creature found mostly under large flat rocks. “You’ve really got to know how to look for them,” says Freake, a biology professor at Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee, who is lifting large rocks and peering under them to find the eastern hellbender. “They’re not easily visible.” Stout-bodied and growing up to two feet in length, this odd-looking and elusive amphibian is designated as endangered in Tennessee. Once abundant through much of their range in the Appalachian Mountains, hellbender populations have drastically declined over the last three decades. For nearly 20 years, Freake has been surveying Tennessee’s rivers and creeks to find where hellbenders still survive and to understand how their populations are doing. “There’s still nothing quite like lifting a rock and seeing a giant enormous salamander just sitting there, staring back at you,” he says.Scientists don’t know for sure why these big salamanders are disappearing. Their main suspects include habitat destruction, water pollution, damming of streams and rivers, and harvest of hellbenders for sale as pets or to bait large game fish. But they’re also growing concerned by the heavier rains and increased river flooding, which are driven by heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuel emissions. Amid these growing threats, many states, including Tennessee, are trying to revive hellbender numbers. Freake is also involved in these efforts, and is working to assess if the interventions are working. “My collaborators and I are just determined they’re not going to disappear on our watch,” he says. “We will do everything we can to make sure they’ll be here for many generations to come.” Between 2012 and 2016, Silva, a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, and his colleaguesfound evidenceof hellbenders in streams flowing through Roan Mountain State Park, among 64 places across the state. The proof arrived in hellbender genetic material lurking in water samples they collected at 284 locations across Tennessee. The technique, called eDNA sampling, uses DNA in the water that had been shed from animals’ skin or poop. It’s an emerging tool to detect rare and elusive species for conservation. Otherwise, it takes six- to eight-hour surveys to find one hellbender, Silva says. “This (eDNA sampling) costs a lot less and saves a lot more time,” he adds. But the DNA doesn’t tell you how many hellbenders are in the area, how old they are, and if their population is healthy. So Freake and his colleagues have been tagging hellbenders with implanted microchips to track their movement, growth, and survival. It could help the researchers identify the threats the local populations might be facing, whether it’s water pollution or habitat degradation or destruction. It may also help them understand why many young hellbenders aren’t making it to adulthood. Arecent studyfound that male hellbenders may be increasingly cannibalizing their own young in areas with less forest cover. The scientists suspect that such degraded sites may have problems with water quality or chemistry or increased silt. Anything going into the river—either covering up the rocks that shelter hellbenders and their eggs or diminishing water quality—could mess up some part of the giant salamanders’ lifecycle, Freake says, such as reducing the survival of hellbenders as eggs or in their larval stage. Another concern is increasing instances of extreme rainfall. These deluges have grown more common with the rise in carbon pollution in the atmosphere from fossil fuels. The heavy rains can cause flash floods. “We’ve had extraordinary rain events that scour rivers and move massive rocks and our feeling is we’ve had some significant [hellbender] mortality events during these crazy flood events,” Freake says. “They also tend to erode banks and put more sediments into the river.” Increased sediment loads can suffocate eggs or fill up spaces where hellbenders live. Other changes caused by carbon emissions, such as rising water temperatures, may also harm hellbender populations. For example, in onesmall experiment, researchers observed that hellbenders stopped eating for three months in the summer when exposed to higher temperatures. “That means they’re going into breeding with poor body conditions and hungry,” says Brian Gratwicke, a conservation biologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute who led the study. “If you’re starving, you want to eat your own eggs.” Hellbenders’ future survival may depend on research into each of these threats. Until then, several states, including Tennessee, are running head-start programs to restore hellbender populations. The process involves collecting eggs or recently-hatched hellbenders in the wild and rearing them in zoos. Once the young ones mature to a size less vulnerable to predation by fish and other animals, they’re released back into the streams. In Tennessee, the program commenced in 2015. Nashville Zoo staff havereleased head-start hellbenders into the wildevery year since 2021. The Chattanooga Zooreleased its first 30 captive-reared hellbendersearlier this year. These salamanders’ survival and the overall success of the program remains to be seen. Other states had mixed results with similar efforts, saysEric Chapman, a hellbender expert and director of aquatic science at Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. “In some places it works well, not everywhere,” he says. Over the next 10 to 20 years scientists in Tennessee will continue to monitor if the introduced hellbenders not only survive but are able to grow and reproduce. “If we get it right, there’s no reason why hellbender populations shouldn’t recover and do well in the future,” Freake says.",True,climatecentral
https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/recreating-in-the-extreme-heat,Recreating in the Extreme Heat,"August 11, 2023","By Sophia Holm (KUNR), Elizabeth Miller (Climate Central) This story was produced through a partnership betweenClimate CentralandKUNR. Eric Mueller was hiking Mt. Rose trail at around 12:30 in mid-July, stopping to let his dog, a mixed breed named Ethel, sit in a pile of snow that hadn’t melted in the shade. He has lived in the Lake Tahoe area for 6 years, and hikes on trails in Galena during the spring before moving higher up in the mountains when temperatures spike. While the heat is much more manageable in the mountains, Mueller says he takes extra precautions to ensure Ethel doesn’t get too hot. “We'll definitely hike in the trees, and then we'll stay in the tree level and not go up above with her and with us. It's still not terrible, but I'm bringing ice water now instead of just regular water, little stuff like that.” Nevada saw scorching temperatures during July, a month that set heat records worldwide. But the heat hasn’t stopped people from enjoying the outdoors--in fact, more hikers are using Nevada trails than ever before. In the hottest summer the world has seen in 120,000 years, changes are rippling through Nevada’s robust outdoor sports scene, not by reducing the number of people coming, but by changing when and where they recreate. The average summer temperature in Renoclimbed about 11°F since 1970.But the heat isn’t scaring people off, at least not yet. Nevada’s Division of Outdoor Recreation saw a 34 percent increase in visitation to state parks since the pandemic. The change in the weather is driving shifts in planning and different approaches to safety, as outdoors people cope with rising temperatures and other impacts of a heating planet. “When we see extreme temperatures like this, we just try to caution people on what they do when they’re recreating,” says Denise Beronio, administrator of the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation, established in 2018 to enhance the $5.5 billion outdoor recreation industry in the state. “We have seen some challenges with people recreating during the heat of the day.” Failing to take changing weather into account can increase risk of heat-related illness. Heat causes an estimated 700 fatalities and more than 9,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. every year. That’s more than all other natural disasters combined. “So this is a real important topic to be aware of, and know how to plan for and how to recognize the symptoms and ultimately know when to treat,” says Dr. Grant Lipman, a former professor at Stanford Emergency Medicine and creator of GOES Health, an app designed for people outdoors to help assess the risks ahead. Dangerous heat increases risk of dehydration and heat stroke, and can affect cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems. Overheating can cause immediate and irreversible damage. Protective proteins begin to break down, allowing blood and fluids to leak and leading to organ failure and shock. “With heat illness, heat stroke, think of dropping an egg onto a hot pan,” Lipman says. “Your body is that egg and it’s frying on the inside.” Drinking water is crucial, Lipman says, but so is consuming salt to prevent over-hydrating. Knowing the symptoms of heat-related illness, which often start with confusion or agitation, can also help head off a crisis that can end in multi-organ failure or death. Planning to spend time in the cooler parts of the day cuts risk. And there’s a silver lining to that approach, says Elisabeth Johnson, deputy administrator for the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation. The state has a string of public lands and rural communities with pristine dark skies for viewing the stars without light pollution from cities clouding the view. Hiking at dusk or even after dark can beat the heat, skip the crowds, and allow for enjoying these unique attractions. “I think sometimes people just think of Vegas and those bright lights and not being able to see the beautiful night sky,” Johnson says. “Nevada is pretty primed for being able to see the stars— once you get out of those kind of major metropolis areas of Vegas and then the Reno area—where you can be just looking up at the sky and see the Milky Way.” In the future, rising temperatures forecast trouble for iconic pastimes, according to a literature review commissioned by Protect Our Winters, a nonprofit organization of outdoor enthusiasts that campaigns for action to mitigate climate change. While this year’s heavy snowpack created more concerns for too much rather than too little water, and led to crowding on the few dry trails, the long-term trend threatens reservoirs, lakes, and rivers. Dwindling water supplies could be a problem for the estimated 8 million people a year who visit the state to fish, paddleboard, and water ski. Wildfire can also damage trails, making hiking, trail running or mountain biking more difficult, or even impossible, and transforming the experience for campers who head to pitch tents in the forest and find blackened burn scars instead. And particulate air pollution from wildfire smoke, like the smoke that blew into Nevada from the Bone wildfire northwest of Yosemite National Park in July, is also linked to breathing discomfort and respiratory problems. People may choose to stay indoors to protect their lungs. “We have seen people starting to make adjustments to their lifestyle and their outdoor recreation activities because of the smoke from fires,” Johnson says. “I had some friends and I noticed that they had bought a stationary bike, and you’re like, ‘What do you need a stationary bike for? We have sunshine 300 days a year,’ and they go, ‘Oh, it's for smoke season.’” When snowpack and weather allow, a lot of hikers turn to the higher elevations around the state, including popular destinations around Lake Tahoe like the Tahoe Rim Trail, a 165-mile path hikers, equestrians, and mountain bikers take to loop around the Lake Tahoe Basin on high ridgelines.Hotter, drier weather has prompted hikers planning to complete the trail to call the association to ask about places to stash water in the woods because some natural sources have dried out. Other areas are drowning in runoff as streams are flooded by the winter’s heavy snowpack. “It’s less of a mediation and more of a feast or famine, so you’re going to get areas that are drowned and areas that are bone dry,” said Anthony Porter, communications director for the Tahoe Rim Trail Association, which supports the Tahoe Rim Trail. “The variation in temperatures and climate has definitely been a challenge.”",True,climatecentral

Global temperatures through July 2023 were 1.29°C (2.32°F) above the 1881-1910 baseline, approaching record levels from 2016. This year has a99% chanceof finishing among the top five on record. Warming will continue as long as carbon pollution continues. We have many options to cut carbon pollution from energy, transportation, agriculture, and more. July 2023 was thehottest month ever recordedon Earth—and by a wide margin. The year-to-date (January to July 2023) global surface temperature ranked 3rd warmest in the 144-year record at 1.29°C (2.32°F) above the early industrial (1881-1910) baseline average. This follows June 2023, which set a record asthe warmest Junefor the globe since NOAA's global records began in 1850. Global ocean surface temperatures also hit record highs in July, which marks the fourth month in a row with record-breaking ocean surface temperatures. The world saw a string of extreme weather and climate disasters last month, including persistent dangerous heat waves across the southern tier of the U.S. and the Caribbean as well as early season coral bleaching in the Florida Keys as ocean temperatures surged to unprecedented July levels. Recentanalysisusing theClimate Shift Index®, Climate Central’s daily temperature attribution tool, indicates that human-caused climate change made July’s extreme heat events far more likely. Globally, 6.5 billion people—81% of the global population—experienced at least one day at CSI level 3 or higher during July 2023. ACSI level 3indicates local conditions that were madeat least three times more likelydue to climate change. In the U.S., 244 million people—73% of the population—experienced at least one July day with temperatures madeat least three times more likelydue to human-caused climate change. U.S. cities with the strongest climate fingerprints on July heat were:Cape Coral, Fla.; Sarasota, Fla.; Bonita Springs, Fla.; Santa Fe, N.M.; Miami, Fla.; Mesa, Ariz.; Albuquerque, N.M. Learn more:Fingerprints of climate change during Earth’s hottest month Heat waves such as those in the U.S. and around the globe this summer arethe deadliest weather-related hazards. The rising global frequency and intensity of these devastating events is consistent withwell-established scientific understandingof the consequences of carbon pollution—mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. According to NOAA, it’s virtually certain that 2023 will be a top 10 hottest year. There’s a99% chanceof 2023 ranking among the top five years on record. Regardless of how 2023 ultimately ranks, the World Meteorological Organization estimates that there’sa 98% chanceof at least one year between 2023 and 2027 exceeding the current warmest year on record (2016). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is “unequivocalthat human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.” Global temperatures get an extra boost during El Niño years, when the warm phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern is layered on top of the primary long-term warming trend due to carbon pollution. El Niño conditionsemerged in May 2023, have strengthened since then, and are likely to continue through the Northern Hemisphere winter. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, at several points during July 2023, global temperaturestemporarily exceeded the 1.5°Cthreshold above the 1850-1900 average—a warming limit set in the Paris Agreement. Climate risks to ecosystems, human health, and livelihoodsincrease along with levels of warming, and every fraction of a degree of avoided warming matters. Nearly 200 countries—including the U.S.—have joined theParis Agreementto limit warming to “well below 2°C (3.6°F)” with the ambition to limit warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). The 1.5°C level specified in the Paris Agreement refers to sustained levels of warming over decades. Temporary (daily or monthly) exceedances like those observed in July 2023 are expected to occur more often as global temperatures approach the long-term threshold. How close are we to reaching global warming of 1.5˚C?If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their recent path, the planet is likely to exceed 1.5°C of warming by the year 2034-2035 according to the latest estimates from the Copernicus Climate Change Serviceglobal temperature trend monitor tooland fromClimate Change Tracker. Warming will continue as long as we emit greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, warm the planet, and lead to more frequent and intense extreme weather events. And global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels have onlycontinued to climb. Limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C will require global emissions topeak by 2025 at the latest—and “deep, rapid and sustained emissions reductions” throughout 2030–2050. It will take major changes to bend the rising curves of CO2 and global temperatures, but we have many options to cut carbon pollution. Every tenth of a degree of avoided warming counts toward a safer future, and there are dozens of options to reduce emissions in each sector of the economy (see Local Story Angles). Climate Solutions in Every Statereviews options to quickly reduce emissions in each U.S. state’s top-emitting sector.

The season has warmed across the U.S. Since 1970, the fall season has warmed in 232 U.S. locations—by 2.4°F on average. Unusually hot fall days now happen more often in 231 locations. And 86 locations now experience at least two more weeks of above-normal fall days than in 1970. Fall warming is widespread across the contiguous U.S., and most intense in the Southwest. Warmer fall temperatures prolong risks of heat-related illness, wildfire, allergies, and more.

This year’shistoric summer heatin the U.S. and across the globe islikely to lingerinto fall. Resulting shifts in risky heat, fire weather, allergies and more can affect ecosystems, human health, and the economy. Climate Central analyzed the last 53 years (1970–2022) of fall (September, October, November) temperature data in 247 U.S. locations. Summaries of the findings below are based on 241 of the locations analyzed (see Methodology). Fall temperatures have increased by 2.7°F on average across the contiguous U.S. since 1970. Fall warming has been universal across the contiguous U.S., but the Southwest and Northern Rockies and Plains regions have experienced above-average warming. Parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah; all of Colorado; most of Wyoming; parts of southern California; northern Minnesota; northern Maine; and eastern Massachusetts have all experienced at least 3.5°F of warming since 1970. Since 1970, average fall temperatures have increased in 232 (96%) of the 241 locations analyzed. The fall season warmed by 2.4°F on average across those 232 locations. Nearly one-third (71) of those locations warmed by 3°F or more since 1970. The top five fall warming locations were: Reno, Nev. (7.7°F); Las Vegas, Nev. (6.1°F); El Paso, Texas (5.7°F); Tucson, Ariz. (5.3°F); and Phoenix, Ariz (5.1°F). The warming season is also reflected in the number of additional fall days with temperatures that exceeded the 1991-2020 normal for the season and location. Since 1970, 231 (96%) of the locations analyzed have seen an increase in the annual number of days above their 1991–2020 fall normal temperature. More than one-third of locations analyzed (86, or 36%) now experienceat least two more weeksof above-normal fall days than in 1970. And 11 locations now experience30 or more fall daysabove normal. These top locations were in Nevada, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and California.

Theannual number of risky heat days has increasedin 232 U.S. locationssince 1970, according to Climate Central analysis. Thosemost at riskfor heat-related illness include children, older adults, people experiencing homelessness, outdoor workers, residents of low income communities, pregnant people, athletes, and others. An extended peak heat season bringshigher cooling demand.Nationwide, fall cooling degree days haveincreased significantlysince 1970. When air conditioners are run later into the year to adapt, energy costs and heat-trapping emissions increase. A warming fall also contributes to longer and more intenseallergy seasonsfor the millions of Americans suffering with allergies and asthma. Hotter falls also mean a longer wildfire season.According to recent Climate Central analysis,wildfire seasons are getting longer and more intense— particularly in the western U.S. Many parts of the eastern U.S., which has nearly 28 million homes located in zones prone to burn, have seen smaller increases in fire weather. Wildfire smoke combined with heat-drivenstagnant aircan further worsen air quality posing additional risk to human health. Warming also allows disease-carrying insects such asmosquitoesto linger laterinto the fall. Fall warming can also disrupt the timing of ecologically important events likebird migrations, hibernation, and fruit ripening. Warmer temperatures during both spring and fall alsoextend the growing season, which can benefit some agricultural crops — but also pests that can reduce crop yields. Warmer growing seasons can also increase the risk of water stressin plants, especially indrought-prone regions of the West and Southwestthat have experienced the most fall warming.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/record-ocean-heat-impacts-from-hurricanes-to-corals,Record Ocean Heat Impacts: From Hurricanes to Corals,"August 23, 2023","Global sea surface temperatures have been continuously hotter than any previous April-August period on record — and by a wide margin. Long-term warming and 2023’s exceptional ocean heat have major implications for both tropical cyclones and coral reefs. Warmer oceans can fuel stronger hurricanes, increasing the risks that they could undergo rapid intensification and cost billions in damage. Ocean warming also risks coral reef bleaching, which can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and people who depend on them. Around Florida coasts and across the Caribbean, corals are currently experiencing record heat stress and risk of bleaching. This summer’s relentless and record-breaking heat hasn’t been limited to land. Over the last four months, global sea surface temperatures have been continuouslyhotter than any April-July periodon record — and by a wide margin. In a typical year, sea surface temperatures decrease from April to July (after summer ends in the Southern Hemisphere, which has a much larger ocean area). But not this year. Temperatures have not decreased since April; they’veincreased, charting an unprecedented path toward a record-shattering July. Sea surface temperatures werehotter in July 2023 than during any other monthsince 1850, followed by June 2023. According to NOAA,48% of the global ocean is currently experiencing marine heat waves— the record largest marine heat wave area of any month since 1991. And these conditions are forecast to continue. This exceptional ocean heat isprimarily due towarming from human-caused carbon pollution and the arrival of El Niño conditions in June. SeeWhy is it so hot this summer?below for more information. We all depend on the ocean. It regulates climate and affects weather on land. It hosts vast biodiversity, provides nutrition for billions, and underpins livelihoods and cultures around the world. But ocean warming disrupts each of these critical functions. And as the planet has warmed in recent decades, about90% of the excess heathas gone into the ocean — mostly the surface ocean, which haswarmed steadilyas a result. Learn more in Climate Central’sOcean Carbonreport andOcean Warmingbrief. Long-term warming and 2023’s exceptional ocean heat have major implications for bothtropical cyclonesandcoral reefs. Sea surface temperatures influence the weather we experience on land. Warm water isa necessary ingredientfortropical cyclones, which include hurricanes and tropical storms. In response to ongoing record-warm oceans, NOAA recently increased its 2023 Atlantic hurricane season outlook toabove normaldespite the ongoing El Niño conditions, which typically limit Atlantic hurricane activity. About80% of major hurricanes(Category 3-5) undergorapid intensification— defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 kt (about 35 mph) in a 24 hour period. And ocean warmingcontributes to an increased fraction of tropical cyclonesthat undergo rapid intensification. Forecasting rapid intensificationcan be challenging, which contributes to the high human and economic toll of such storms. Of the 56 tropical cyclones that have caused at least $1 billion in damage in the U.S. from 1980-2021,73%underwent rapid intensification. The six most costly hurricanes since 1980 — which caused a combined estimated$744 billion(inflation-adjusted) in damages — all had maximum rapid intensification rates between 40-70 kt in 24 hours. Learn more in Climate Central’sExtreme Weather Toolkit: Tropical Cyclones Coral reefs are the world’s most diverse marine ecosystems. Aboutone-quarter of all marine speciesdepend on corals. Corals support fisheries that provide nutrition and livelihoods, especially in the tropics. Coral reefs also provide coastal protection during tropical storms. Each year, coral reefs in the U.S. provide$3.4 billionin economic value from fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection. But these valuable ecosystems are also extremely vulnerable to climate change. Long-term ocean warming and more frequentmarine heatwaveslike those currently affecting many parts of the globe cause heat-stress in corals — which can lead tocoral bleachingand death. Zooxanthellae, the single-celled algae that live within coral tissues, provide food and color to corals. But when waters reach1-2°C above the normal rangefor an extended time, algae leave the coral, resulting in coral bleaching. Bleaching drains corals of their algae and their color, leaves corals at high risk for disease, and can ultimately lead to coral death. It can take reefs decades to recover from mass coral bleaching events, which can be devastating to marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them. Mass bleaching events were first observed in the 1980s. Since then, there have been three majorglobal coral bleaching events, the most recent occurred in 2015-2017, the last El Niño year. Mass coral bleaching events are most prevalentin tropical mid-latitudes. Florida is home to one of severalmajor coral reef areas in U.S. states and territories. This year’s record-shattering sea surface temperatures are putting Florida’s corals under extreme heat stress. TheNOAA Coral Reef Watchprogram’s daily Bleaching Area Alert shows extreme risk to corals along around Florida and the Caribbeanexpanding and accelerating through the summerand into mid-August. The Bleaching Area Alert is a measure of the combinedintensityanddurationof coral heat stress. There are two alert levels. Both levels have the same heat intensity threshold (sea surface temperature anomalies of 1°C or higher), combined with either: Level 1:4 to 8degree heating weeks, indicating significant bleaching is likely Level 2:8 or more degree heating weeks, indicating severe bleaching and significant mortality is likely BothSoutheast Florida and the Florida Keyshave exceeded a Bleaching Alert Level 2 this summer. And they’ve reached these thresholdsearlier and by a wider marginthan any other year on record, back to 1985. These dangerous conditions are projected to continue in theFlorida KeysandSoutheast Floridafor at least another month, putting Florida's corals at unprecedented heat stress. NOAA and partner local organizations will continue tomonitor and rescue coralsduring Florida’s historic bleaching event. NOAA’sCoral Reef Conservation Programworks to conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems across U.S. states and territories over the long-term. And there areways that people can help protect coralseven if they live far from the coast. But until ocean warming stops at the main source — carbon pollution — coral bleaching is likely tobecome more frequentamong the world’s coral reefs. According torecent IPCC reports, “multiple lines of evidence indicate that the majority (70–90%) of warm water (tropical) coral reefs that exist today will disappear even if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C.” Unprecedented summer heat has prompted rapid analyses of the human-caused and natural factors influencing recent trends. AnAugust 14 analysisfrom Berkeley Earth confirms that human-caused warming—the direct result of emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2—isthe primary factordriving long-term warming trends. The next most important factor is the recent and strengthening El Niño, the warm ENSO phase thatboosts global temperatureson top of the primary warming from human activities. Several other factors are also contributing to short-term warming, including: a phase of increasing solar activity, warming effects of a 15% increase in stratospheric water vapor following the January 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano eruption, and the reduction of sulfur aerosols from heavy shipping due to recent pollution and health regulations. In theNorth Atlantic,sea surface temperatures for the month of July 2023 weresubstantially warmerthan any previous July on record.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/global-review-June-August-2023,Carbon pollution boosted heat for billions during Earth’s hottest summer,"September 7, 2023","Earth just had its hottest Northern Hemisphere summer on record, and many parts of the globe experienced record-shattering and dangerous heat from June through August. Analysis using theClimate Shift Index®, Climate Central’s daily temperature attribution system, finds that human-caused climate change made the unprecedented heat far more likely. Nearly half (48%) of the world’s population experienced at least 30 June-August dayswith a Climate Shift Index (CSI) level 3 or higher — heat madeat least three times more likelyby climate change. On each day in June-August, between 1.5 and 4.2 billion peoplefelt a very strong influence of climate change (CSI level 3 or higher). Heat at CSI level 3 or higherpersisted for at least half the June-August period in 79 countriesthroughout Central America, the Caribbean, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Africa. Countries with the lowest historical emissions experiencedthree-to-four times more June-August dayswith CSI level 3 or higher than G20 countries (the world’s largest economies). Download data: Climate Shift Index (CSI) for June to August 2023, by day and by country Stay tuned:Our September 13 Climate Matters will review summer 2023 in 247 U.S. cities, including local graphics and climate fingerprints.Following the planet’shottest June ever recorded, global temperatures werecontinuously hotterthan any previous July-August period on record. July 2023 was Earth’shottest month on record. Therecord-shatteringNorthern Hemisphere summer temperatures brought dangerous heat waves to many parts of the globe and fueled wildfires in North America, Europe, and Africa. Record-breaking summer heat also occurred in the ocean, elevating the risk of rapidly-intensifying tropical cyclones like Hurricane Idalia and coral bleaching events like those impacting Florida and the Caribbean. Heat waves are the deadliest weather-related hazards, and their rising global frequency and intensity is consistent withwell-established scientific understandingof the consequences of carbon pollution—mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. When it comes to specific heat events,climate change attributionuses statistical methods to quantify the influence of human-caused climate change on a particular event’s likelihood. Climate Central’s daily attribution system, theClimate Shift Index(CSI), applies the latest peer-reviewed methodology to map the influence of climate change on temperatures across the globe, every day. The CSI is based on the relative frequency of daily temperatures in the current climate and in a world without human-caused climate change. For example, a CSI level of 3 indicates local conditions that were madeat least three times more likelydue to climate change. SeeWhat is the Climate Shift Index (CSI)?below for more information. New Climate Central analysis used theClimate Shift Index(CSI) to quantify the influence of human-caused climate change on daily average temperatures experienced in 202 countries and territories across the globe during the Northern Hemisphere summer 2023 (June 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023). SeeMethodologybelow for details. Throughout the text below, “summer” is used to refer to the June-August 2023 period. Over 3.8 billion people — 48% of the global population — experienced at least 30 days during June-August with a CSI level 3 or higher. A CSI level 3 indicates that human-caused climate change made those temperaturesat least three times more likely. At least 1.5 billion people felt a very strong influence of climate change (CSI level 3 or higher) on each day during June-August 2023.Global exposure peaked on August 16, 2023, when 4.2 billion people worldwide experienced extreme heat at CSI level 3 or higher. Positive CSI levels (1 to 5) indicate conditions that will become more likely and more frequent as climate change accelerates.Approximately two-thirds of the global population (5.3 billion people) experienced an average CSI level 1 or higher during June-August 2023. These numbers will grow over time until humans stop burning coal, oil, and natural gas. Very strong fingerprints of climate change (CSI level 3 or higher) persisted for at least half of the June-August 2023 period in: north Africa; the Gulf of Guinea coastline; parts of central Africa, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa; the Arabian Peninsula; the Mediterranean Basin; parts of India; the Malay Archipelago; the Amazon Basin; the Andes; Central America and the Caribbean; Mexico; the southern tier of the United States; western Canada; and northern Greenland. Seventy-nine countries experienced at least half of all June-August days at CSI level 3 or higher. More than half of these (49, or 62%) were U.N.-designatedleast developed countriesandsmall island developing states, which together account for approximately 7% of cumulative historical greenhouse gas emissions. Countries with lowest emissions experienced approximately three to four times moreJune-August days with very strong climate fingerprints than the G20 countries (the world’s largest economies). However, states and regions within several G20 countries had notable exposure to climate-driven heat. For example, the U.S. states of Hawai’i, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Florida, and Arizona, along with parts of Spain and Italy, experienced 30 or more days at CSI level 3. At least half of all June-August days were a CSI level 3 or higher in: Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Mexico, 11 Indian states (Kerala, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar, Meghalaya, Goa, Karnataka, Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland, and Tamil Nadu), and five Brazilian states (Amapá, Roraima, Pará, Amazonas, and Acre). According to the United Nations,small island developing statesare a group of low-lying island nations that are home to approximately 65 million people and are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change — despite being responsible for less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There are currently 46least developed countriesdesignated by the United Nations as “low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development.” The least developed countries have a collective population of around 880 million people, and account for approximately 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Global average temperatures were hotter than ever during the Northern Hemisphere summer 2023. But people don't experience global average temperatures. Instead, we mainly experience climate change through shifts in the daily temperatures and weather patterns where we live. Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index(CSI) system quantifies the local influence of climate change on daily temperatures around the world. The CSI quantifies how much human-caused climate change has shifted the odds of daily temperatures that people experience locally. The CSI system is grounded inpeer-reviewed attribution scienceand was launched by Climate Central in 2022. TheCSIsystem is free to access. The CSI is based on the ratio of the local frequency of a particular daily temperature in the current climate to the estimated frequency of that temperature in a world without human-caused climate change. The Climate Shift Index (CSI) has 11 levelsthat indicate how climate change has altered the frequency of daily high, low, and average temperatures at a given location. CSI levels from 1 to 5indicate that human-caused climate change has made the observed or forecasted temperatures more likely or, equivalently, more common. CSI levels from -1 to -5indicate temperatures that are becoming less likely or less common due to human-caused climate change. watch ourvideo explainer explorethe FAQson our website read ourpeer-reviewed methods paper Here are four ways to use this attribution analysis from Climate Central: Use the tools.Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index map toolshows which parts of the world are experiencing high CSI levels, every day.

All Climate Shift Index (CSI) levels reported in this brief are based on daily average temperatures from June 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023. For this analysis, Climate Central usedERA5 datafrom June 1 to August 31, 2023. See thefrequently asked questionsfor details on computing the Climate Shift Index, including a summary of the multi-model approach described inGilford et al. (2022). For each day, we identified the grid cells with CSI values of 3 or higher. We then totaled the estimated population based on theGridded Population of the World v4estimate for 2020, and proportionally scaled the population up to current estimates for global population. The country-level analysis includes 202 countries and territories. It excludes entities that are smaller than 0.25°, the size of a grid cell. For this analysis, we calculated the temperature anomaly, mean CSI, and number of days at CSI level 3 or higher (all based on average temperature) over the June 1 to August 31, 2023 period. For each country, we then selected the data within its geographical boundary and spatially averaged the temperature anomaly, mean CSI, and the number of days at CSI level 3 or higher. Reported temperature anomalies are relative to each country’s 1991-2020 normal June - August average temperature.

New Climate Central analysis shows which U.S. cities, states, and regions felt the strongest influence of climate change on summer heat. In the U.S., 326 million people—97% of the population—experienced at least one summer day with temperatures madeat least 2x more likelydue to human-caused climate change. The U.S.South, Southwest, and Southeastexperienced the strongest climate fingerprints on summer daily average temperatures. Of the 244 U.S. cities analyzed,71% (175) had seven or more dayswith average temperatures made at least 2x more likely by climate change. In 45 U.S. cities, at least half of all summer dayshad heat made at least 2x more likely by climate change. More than half of these cities were in Texas (17) and Florida (11). U.S. cities with the most hot summer days made at least 2x more likely by climate change were: San Juan, Puerto Rico (90 days); Victoria, Texas (80 days); Lafayette, La. (74 days). This summer was also marked by relentless heat streaks. Some15 cities in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Alabama, and Arizona had record streaksof summer days above 100°F. 2023 has had a record 23 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters so far totalling $57.6 billion. Download data: Summer 2023 Climate Shift Index and record heat streaks in U.S. cities This brief focuses on the U.S.Check out ourprevious Climate Matters brieffor a global analysis of June-August heat boosted by climate change. June, July, and August 2023 temperatures shattered global records for all three months. Summer’s record heat was strongly influenced by human-caused climate change around the globe, according to Climate Central’sClimate Shift Index (CSI). Nearly half (48%) of the world’s populationexperienced at least 30 days during June-August with a Climate Shift Index (CSI) level 3 or higher — indicating temperatures madeat least 3x more likelydue to climate change. Summer heat boosted by climate change brought extreme heat to many parts of the globe. In the U.S. and North America: Relentless, record-breaking July heat waves in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texaswould have been virtually impossiblewithout human-caused climate change, according to World Weather Attribution analysis. Climate change alsomore than doubled the likelihoodof extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada in May and June that began a record Canadian fire season and brought unhealthy smoke to many U.S. cities. Record-breaking summer heat also occurred in the ocean, elevating the risk of rapidly-intensifying hurricanes like Idalia and Lee and coral bleaching events like those impacting Florida and the Caribbean. The rising global frequency and intensity of extreme heat is consistent withwell-established scienceon the warming effects of carbon pollution — mainly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. New Climate Central analysis showswhich U.S. cities, states, and regions felt the strongest influence of climate changeon heat over the 92 days of this record-breaking summer. This analysis used theClimate Shift Index(CSI) to quantify the influence of human-caused climate change on daily average temperatures experienced in 244 U.S. cities during summer 2023 (June 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023). SeeMethodologybelow for details. In the U.S., 326 million people—97% of the population—experienced at least one summer day with temperatures madeat least 2x more likely(CSI level 2 or higher) due to human-caused climate change. The U.S.South, Southwest, and Southeastexperienced the strongest influence of human-caused climate change on daily average temperatures. In the South, the average city had 49 summer days (53% of the season) with heat madeat least 2x more likelyby climate change. Of the 244 U.S. cities analyzed: nearly all (237 cities, or 96%) had one or more summer dayswith heat madeat least 2x more likelydue to climate change. 175 cities (71%) had seven or more dayswith heat made at least 2x more likely due to climate change. one-quarter (65 cities) had 30 or more dayswith heat madeat least 2x more likelydue to climate change. Of the 244 U.S. cities analyzed,45 cities had at least half of all summer days(at least 46 out of 92 total summer days) with heat madeat least 2x more likelydue to climate change. More than half of these 45 cities were in Texas (17 cities) and Florida (11 cities),but also included cities in: Puerto Rico, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Alabama, Hawai’i, Alaska, and Arizona. The nine cities that felt the most relentless influence of climate changeexperienced heat madeat least 2x more likelyby climate change on 77% to 98% of all summer days. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, 98% of the summer (all but two days)had heat madeat least 2x more likelyby climate change. Even at the highest level on the CSI scale (CSI level 5), 92% of all summer days (85 days) in San Juan were madeat least 5x more likelydue to climate change. Heat events with a CSI level 5 would be very difficult to encounter in a world without climate change — not necessarily impossible, but very, very unlikely. In other words,nearly every summer day in San Juan had an exceptional influence of climate changeon average temperatures. The second-ranked U.S. city (Victoria, Texas) had 68 days (74% of the summer) at CSI level 5. This summer was also marked by record-breaking heat streaks. Some15 cities in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Alabama, and Arizona had record-breaking heat streaksat or above 100°F. Topping the list were: Tucson, Ariz. (53 consecutive days); Bryan, Texas (50 consecutive days); and Austin, Texas (45 consecutive days). At even higher levels of heat,Phoenix, Ariz. had record-breaking streaksat or above 105°F (56 days) and 110°F (31 days). Relentless back-to-back days of extreme heat amplify the risks of heat-related illness — especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and outdoor workers. According to NOAA, in the first eight months of 2023 (as of September 11) the U.S. has already experienced a record 23 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters — with combined estimated losses of $57.6 billion. The year-to-date count of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters puts 2023 ahead of the previous annual record of 22 billion-dollar disasters set in 2020. Ten of these events occurred during spring (March-May) and 11 occurred during summer (June-August). Most of these events (18) were severe storms primarily in the South and Central U.S. The frequency of billion-dollar severe storms hasincreased sharplysince 1980. Learn more:Extreme Weather Toolkit: Severe Weather. The 23 total year-to-datebillion-dollar disastersalso include devastating August wildfires in the historic town of Lahaina on Maui, and flooding in California (January-March) and Vermont and New Hampshire (July). NOAA’s latest (September 11) update did not include damage estimates for Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall on August 30 as a Category 3 major hurricane and swept across Florida and Georgia.  It is worth noting that, while extreme heat is deadly, heatwaves like what the U.S. experienced this summer in the South and Southwest are not included in these disaster statistics.

https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/rising-seas-flooding-coasts-2023,"Rising Seas, Flooding Coasts","September 27, 2023","Click to download custom graphics Click to download custom graphics Click to download custom graphics As sea levels rise, flooding is becoming more common along U.S. coasts, where about 30% of the population lives. High tide flooding can occur in the absence of heavy rainfall or storms, and the effects can be disruptive, dangerous, and costly for coastal communities. The annual frequency of high tide flooding in the U.S. has more than doubled since 2000 — and is projected to more than triple again by 2050 as sea levels continue to rise. According to NOAA outlooks for 2023, the annual risk of high tide flooding is expected to peak during late September and October in many locations along the East and Gulf Coasts. In our warming climate, it no longer takes a strong storm to flood streets, homes, businesses, and ecosystems along the coast. High tide flooding— also callednuisance floodingorsunny day flooding— is becoming more common in the U.S., where29% of the populationlives in coastal counties. As global sea levels rise, water levels along the coast rise too. As daily tides cycle over higher baseline water levels, high tide lines migrate farther inland or upslope — regularly flooding coastal areas that previously would have flooded only during storms or extreme rainfall events. High tide flooding happens when water levels exceed 1-2 feet above the daily average high tide (the threshold for minor high tide flooding). Such flooding can clog storm water drains, flood streets, inundate coastal infrastructure and ecosystems, and affect freshwater supplies. These impacts worsen during so-calledking tides, the highest astronomical tides of the year. Flood risks compound if extreme high tides also overlap with heavy rains or storms. Earlier this year, NOAA released a new interactiveMonthly High Tide Flooding Outlookthat shows how likely high tide flooding is on each day of the year at 98 coastal U.S. locations. According to NOAA outlooks for 2023, the annual risk of high tide flooding is expected to peak during late September and October in many locations along the East and Gulf Coasts. The oceans absorb90% of the extra heatcaused by carbon pollution. Asoceans heat up, the volume of seawater expands — causing sea levels to rise. Melting glaciers and ice sheets also contribute to rising sea levels. Global mean sea level rose 7.8 inches from 1901 to 2018, according tothe latest IPCC reports. Sea levels have been rising faster since the late 1960s, andhuman activities are the primary cause. Sea level rise is accelerating along U.S. coasts.According to NOAA, sea levels along U.S. coasts are expected to rise as muchover the next 30 years(10-12 inches, on average) as they did over the last 100 years. Rising sea levels have contributed to the increased frequency of coastal flooding in the U.S. — especially in the last two decades. The annual frequency of U.S. high tide floodinghas more than doubled since 2000. Flood frequency is projected to more than triple again by 2050 (relative to 2020) to reach a national average of45 to 85 flood days per year. The Northeast, Southeast, and Gulf Coasts have experienced the largest historical increase in high tide flooding. Last year,eight U.S. locationssaw record or record-breaking numbers of high tide flood days, including in Florida, Puerto Rico, Virginia, Georgia, and Washington state. A strengtheningEl Niñocould furtherboost coastal flooding during 2023-2024alongboth the East and West Coastsdue to regional effects on storms and sea level. The latest science is clear: we can expect more coastal flooding far into the future,due to rising emissions causing rising sea levels. In the absence of measures to both rapidly curb emissions and reduce risk, coastal flood impacts are likely to become increasingly damaging and destructive. People, ecosystems, and infrastructure along the coast will be directly affected by flooded homes, streets, and businesses, erosion, stormwater overflows, and reduced water quality. But such impacts alongU.S. coastscan have far-reaching effects. U.S. coasts are essential for trade and supply chains we all depend on. They’re home to large and growing populations. Recreation, tourism, and fisheries are all thriving coastal industries. And ecosystems such aswetlandsprovide coastal protection, wildlife habitat, and carbon storage. Thus, the entire country is directly or indirectly affected by the inundation of our coasts as sea levels continue to rise. Reversing recent trends ultimately requires rapid and sustained emissions cuts. But even underlow-emissions scenarios, sea levels will continue to rise. Ways that coastal communities canreduce risk and enhance resilienceto future flooding include raising roads, stabilizing shorelines, relocating low-lying buildings, and restoring coastal ecosystems.

NOAA defines three high tide flooding thresholds: Minor (disruptive) is about 1.75-2 feet above average high tide; Moderate (damaging) is about 2.75-3 feet above average high tide; Major (destructive) is about 4 feet above average high tide. Unless otherwise stated, text and graphics in this Climate Matters refer to the NOAA-defined minor flooding threshold. Annual high tide flooding (at NOAA-defined minor threshold) and relative sea level rise data for 35 tide gauges over the 1950-2022 period were obtained fromNOAA(click for detailed tide gauge information). Gauges were selected based on period of record and data completeness.

As the remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary washed over his Malheur County fields, longtime onion farmer Bruce Corn hunkered down in his office taking care of paperwork. He was philosophical about the unpredictably changing conditions that have buffeted the Treasure Valley’s farmers over recent years. “Every year is different. That’s just farming,” Corn said. “Each year you have different weather patterns and circumstances. You are working with nature and you are subject to those forces all the time.” But weather extremes in the western Treasure Valley have become more common – including heat, drought, and precipitation. Shay Myers of Owyhee Produce in Nyssa said the drastic weather in the last few years has impacted yields. Some years have been good, others not. Scientists say climate change has made seasonal weather more unpredictable. That could continue to complicate onion production – the biggest earner in Malheur County’s agriculture economy. Extreme conditions can damage plants, reduce yields, and disrupt farming practices. In 2021, an unprecedented heat dome blanketed much of the Pacific Northwest during the early growing season. And last summer, a very wet spring was followed by temperatures that rose quickly, shocking onion crops. Data from the state Department of Agriculture shows below-average onion yields in both years. “All crops are sort of like Goldilocks, they do really well within a certain range of temperatures,” said Stuart Reitz, director Oregon State University’s Malheur Experiment Station. If temperatures get too hot or too cold at the wrong stage of their growth, plants can shut down. “Maybe we are in a climate change period. I don’t know,” Corn said, in his farm office. “A lot of people tell us that is the case. But, nevertheless, we have to adapt and deal with the circumstances as they are.” In the last decade, onion production brought in about $640 million dollars to growers in Malheur County, its highest-value crop. Spanish sweet and yellow onions were most common, and farmers also grew many red and white onions. Packaging sheds and processors in the county multiplied the economic value. Generations have grown onions here. Myers said that’s because the Treasure Valley’s fertile soils give growers, “a great opportunity to produce great onions.” The growing season here has provided the optimum heat and dryness that the onions require. But recent years have brought more extreme heat to the onion-growing region. Nearby Boise is experiencing 22 more extremely hot days per year than in 1970, according to an analysis by Climate Central. When hotter temperatures don’t let up, onions can undergo heat stress, causing farmers to produce less. Heat stress can also cause the size of the onion bulb to be smaller. Hot temperatures can stop the onion plant from producing top leaves, which help protect the bulb from sunburn. And because onions have shallow roots, warmer topsoil can stress the plant from the bottom up. Nighttime temperatures are warming faster than daytime temperatures, said Erica Fleishman, director of Oregon Climate Change Research Institute. Since 1970, average summer nighttime temperatures have warmed by more than 7 degrees in Boise. Rising nighttime temperatures can be even more problematic for onions, Reitz said, because the plant can’t cool off at night. Hotter nights can encourage pests and mold. Thrips are one pest that thrives under hotter temperatures and can be a major threat to onions, damaging the crop and reducing production. Wildfire smoke also can block sunlight onions need. Besides the new variations in temperature, recent decades have seen a shift in precipitation. Long-term records show the Western U.S. experiencing less snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and less precipitation falling as snow. That change leads to greater water demand during the growing season, which can be problematic for the arid Treasure Valley where crops need to be irrigated. In the last two decades, most years have been drier than the state’s 30-year average, Fleishman said. In 2022, most of Oregon spent more than 40 consecutive weeks in a drought. Bouts of intense winter storms don’t always bring recovery from droughts. Sustained precipitation is better for increasing soil moisture and replenishing groundwater needed for irrigation. For farmers, long-term precipitation and the level of water in reservoirs play into calculations about how to raise the valley’s key crops. “Last year we were in more of a drought situation, so cropping plans were totally different,” Corn said. “If you are not assured of an adequate supply of water you have to make adjustments about where you put your onion crop and a lot of that has to be determined about this time every year.” That decision drives other actions to prepare for the next year’s crop, he said. “For our high value crops, and onions are high value, by November, before this cropping year ends, we will have chemicals supplied and fumigation, all the land prep will be done,” Corn said. This year’s snowpack brought a good supply of water. Corn said full reservoirs can make decisions easier. “It’s like having money in the bank,” he said. “Any given year you can somewhat look forward, but any given year can be an outlier.” To tackle drought and extreme heat, growers and researchers are getting creative. Researchers at the OSU Malheur Experiment Station – appropriately situated on Onion Avenue – are working on new varieties with all the attributes of Treasure Valley onions, but that are also resilient to heat, Reitz said. Growers are trying different methods to protect onion bulbs from the sunburn that occurs when leaves don’t fully develop due to heat stress, Reitz said. One solution is intercropping. Farmers plant other crops in between rows of onions to provide shade. But that solution can be challenging, depending on water demands and the irrigation set up needed for each crop. Growers are also using cover crops to increase the amount of nutrients in the soil as well as to keep the soil moist in between onion harvest and planting. Farmers have worked for years to improve irrigation, conserving water and making scarce supplies last longer. “Twenty years ago, there were very few sprinkler systems or drip irrigation for onions,” Corn said. “Now you see drip irrigation everywhere. … Now you use half the water, and that makes the supplies you have to go much further.” Reitz said that growers are “cautiously optimistic” that this will be a better year, even though a wet spring led to a slower start to the season. But until onions are harvested in late August through October, growers are on high alert. Myers said he is hopeful about the growth of onions in Malheur County. He said farmers should come together and share their stories. And customers should, “Be willing to pay the extra dollar to support local.” Riding out the rains of Hilary, Corn was ready to take in stride whatever changes are coming. “The climate has been something that has been an issue for a farmer since time immemorial,” he said. “So you either adapt or leave the farming life.

https://www.climatecentral.org/partnership-journalism/devastating-floods-leave-detroiters-with-toxic-mold,Devastating floods leave Detroiters with toxic mold,"September 29, 2023","By Michael Gerstein (Climate Central) and Jena Brooker (BridgeDetroit) This story was produced through a collaboration betweenClimate Central,BridgeDetroit, andGrist. Wilma Price was sleeping in her basement bedroom in 2021 when she woke up to a cacophony of noise, including an alarm coming from her sump pump, a device meant to prevent basement flooding. As she sat up in bed she saw her freezer and its contents floating by on several inches of water. The bedroom of her home in Detroit’s Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood was quickly flooding with water coming in from the toilet and shower. “I thought I was dreaming,” said Price, 69. “It was gushing out of my toilet like a geyser, it was coming out of my shower. … I just couldn’t believe my eyes. It was so terrifying.” The alarm she heard was the crying sound of her sump pump failing as approximately four feet of water accumulated, almost entirely engulfing the stairs from her basement and destroying computers, furniture, appliances, and most tragically, photos of her siblings, parents, and husband, all of whom have died. After a few days the water receded, but black mold — a toxic fungus — developed. As fossil fuel pollution traps heat, flooding is intensifying and disasters are becoming more frequent and more intense. The floods are wreaking financial damages, and they’re exacerbating health hazards as flooded streets and basements foster mold and release pathogens from raw sewage. In Rust Belt cities like Detroit with combined sewer and rainwater systems, untreated sewage can back up into streets and homes when pipes become overwhelmed with stormwater. Price paid thousands of dollars to eradicate the mold by ripping out the floors, several feet of her walls, and all of her new bathroom fixtures. Sometime this spring, Price moved the winter coats she had stored in a closet on the home’s first floor and found black mold crawling up about a foot of the wall. Then she found it in a second room on the opposite side of the house. Price wonders where else the mold might be silently growing from that day in 2021. * * * Extreme rainfall events like Detroit’shistoric floodin 2021 are growing more common because of climate change. The floods of years past will likely be dwarfed by the deluges of the future, powered by a warmer atmosphere that’s able to hold more moisture, climate scientists say. “It doesn’t take much imagination to think about how serious this problem is, especially for children born in Detroit and living in those environments,” said Peter Larson, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan and one of the lead authors on a 2021study, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, that found more than half of almost 4,000 Detroit homes surveyed had experienced recurrent flooding between 2012 and 2020. “They face lifelong problems from asthma,” Larson said. Among the Detroit homes included in the study, 84 percent that had flooded in the past were found to have mold in the basement. An additional 55.4 percent of homes that had not flooded during those years still had moldy basements — underscoring the fact that more frequent, climate-induced rainfall can pose problems even for homes that haven’t flooded, because with more rain comes more moisture. Detroit received more than 25,000 calls on June 25, 2021, when six to eight inches of rain washed across the city over two days, leading to disaster declarations in four Detroit-area counties and 67,000 damage claims with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. About 24,000 damage claims were also filed with the regional water authority in Metro Detroit, all of whichwere deniedbecause water officialsdeemedwidespread basement flooding to be inevitable. Several pump stations that move water out of the east side of Detroit failed that day due to electrical issues. Still, authorities said there was just too much rain for the system to handle. Following the flood, President Joe Bidendeclared an emergencyfor the state of Michigan, opening up more federal funding for flood victims. Before that, in 2014, four to six inches of rain left Detroit with$1.8 billion in direct flood damages, according to the National Weather Service. Then again in 2016, 2019, and 2020,major rainfallcaused severe flooding in Detroit. “The last flood was the worst of them all. It was devastating,” said LeJuan Council, a Detroit resident whose home has flooded. Council lives in the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, which has experienced some of the worst effects of Detroit flooding because of its low elevation, its proximity to the Detroit River, and the way the sewer system is designed. “We are all very clearly in a depressing situation around this time of year — you should typically be able to enjoy the sun, but summer rain is becoming violent for us.” This has profoundly concerning health implications for Detroit residents. “What you have is a situation where residents are facing just an enormous amount of potential challenges because of this,” said Lyke Thompson, director of Wayne State University’s Center for Urban Studies and a mold researcher. “A number of older and younger adults in that neighborhood already have asthma, and we have found from a larger study … an association between flooding and asthma occurrence in Detroit. “The mold was the major thing that was still there months after [the 2021 flood]. And we still are going into homes and finding mold in that neighborhood,” he said. * * * Other research conducted after extreme weather events, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has shown high mold levels indoors can lead to or exacerbate a host of health problems, including asthma, respiratory infections, bronchitis, allergies, and even neurological damage. Anumber of studieshave shown that mold can even increase the risk of developing asthma for the first time in both children and adults. This is particularly concerning in Detroit, which has some of the highest asthma rates in the country. Larson and other researchers found a positive association between mold growth and asthma in the thousands of Detroit homes they surveyed: A whopping 74.4 percent of households that had flooded in recent years reported having at least one adult in the home who had been diagnosed with asthma. “We’re seeing an overburdened set of communities who keep experiencing a lot of the local industry and commercial truck traffic, and you just keep adding these layers on top,” said Natalie Sampson, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan’s College of Education, Health and Human Services, and another author on the 2021 study. “Mold from flooding is just one more contributor that can really spark asthma symptoms, that’s for sure.”",True,climatecentral

This year is part of a trend of increasing fire weather, which fuels the flames and smoke that put health and safety at risk in our warming climate. Fine particle pollution from wildfire smoke is a nationwide health concern. Studies suggest that smoke exposure in the U.S. has increased 27-fold over the last decade. The West has more large fires and local smoke-related pollution, but fires from the western U.S. and Canada affect the entire contiguous U.S. New research links wildfire smoke with stalled or reversed air quality improvements in 30 U.S. states since 2016, with the worst effects in the West. Download a .kmlversionof the Annual Average Wildfire Smoke Days map This year’s wildfire season has broken records across the Northern Hemisphere. In August, dry weather and strong winds from Hurricane Dora fueled the deadliest U.S. fire in over a century, devastating the historic town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Extreme heat fueled intense fires in northern and central Greece, resulting in evacuations, loss of life, and the country’s third-smokiestJuly-August periodon record. Canada’s wildfire season has been relentless and record-shattering, leaving a totalburned arearoughly equivalent to the size of Oklahoma. That’s about6.5 timesCanada’s 10-year average burned area. Climate changemore than doubled the likelihoodof extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada in May and June that began Canada’s record fire season and brought unhealthy smoke to many U.S. cities and even across the Atlantic toEurope. The smoke from Canada’s massive, ongoing fire season hasmore than doubledthe country’s previous annual record for fire-related air pollution. Smoke pollution hascontinued to climbthrough September as fires continue to rage in western Canada, forcing mass evacuations. Wildfire smoke can travel far and harm healthhundreds or even thousands of miles away from where fires burn. This is what the U.S. has experienced in 2023, largely due to Canada’s record fire season. The average person in the U.S. has been exposed to far more smoke-related air pollution in 2023 than during any other year since 2006, according to data from theStanford Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab. In 2023 (through August 31), the average person in the U.S. has experienced about 66% more fine particle pollution from smoke than during the previous record year (2021). Wildfire smoke is a complex mix of pollutants, butfine particle pollutionaccounts forabout 90%— and is the main threat to human health. Fine particle pollution (known as PM2.5) includes particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. That’s less than 5% of the width of a human hair. When people breathe in wildfire smoke, these tiny particles can make their way deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream, causinga range of health effectsfrom minor irritation to seriouscardiovascular and respiratoryillness. Emerging research suggests that wildfire smoke can also affect learning outcomes.A recent study found that exposure to fine particle pollution from wildfire smoke corresponds tolower test scoresamong U.S. students aged eight to 14 years. Fine particle pollution can affect anyone but some people face higher risks,including the elderly,pregnantpeople,children, and those with chronic conditions such asasthma, COPD, and heart disease. Some people, includingwildland firefighters, first responders, andoutdoor workers, also face higher risks of exposure to fire and smoke during wildfire outbreaks. According to a recent study, the number of people in the U.S. that experience at least one day each year with smoke-related fine particle pollution levels at 3x over the EPA standard hasincreased 27-fold over the last decade. In 2020 alone, 25 million people in the U.S. experienced at least one smoke exposure day at this level. And per-capita smoke pollution exposure in 2023 has already been more than double the 2020 levels. Theaverage number of wildfire smoke days each yearis highest in the western U.S. Parts of California, Oregon, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida experience an average of 90-111 wildfire smoke days each year. Although wildfire smoke is most acute in parts of the West, it’s a universal air quality issue. Every county in the contiguous U.S. now sees at least 16 wildfire smoke days each year. Wildfire smoke accountsfor up to one-quarterof all fine particle pollution across the U.S., and up to half in parts of the West. Western fires account for about half of the smoke experienced in the rest of the contiguous U.S. The Northeast and Midwest are routinely affected by wildfire smoke from Canadian wildfires. About60% of smoke in the Northeastin recent years came from fires outside the U.S. Although most large fires occur in the western U.S., aboutthree-quarters of mortality and asthma morbidity linked to smokefine particle pollution occurs in other U.S. regions, due to long-range smoke transport and higher population density in eastern U.S. regions. The same study found that asthma morbidity linked to smoke is highest during spring and summer iIn most U.S. regions. Over the last six years, wildfire smoke has influenced trends in fine particle pollution innearly three-quarters of statesin the contiguous U.S. Increases in wildfire smoke since 2016 have either stalled (in 22 states) or reversed (in eight states) decades-long air quality improvements. The worst effects have been felt in California, Oregon, and Washington, where air quality is affected both by local fires and by fires in western Canada. If these trends continue, they threaten to undo decades of air quality improvements under the Clean Air Act. Large-scale atmospheric circulation can transport wildfire smoke hundreds and even thousands of miles, affecting local air quality in places far from active fires. The transport and dispersion of wildfire smoke involves both horizontal and vertical motion processes. The extreme energy and intense convection associated with wildfires candischarge smoke aerosols beyond the planetary boundary layerinto the free troposphere — as high as 60,000 feet in the air. Prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere can then transport smoke particles long distances. This is how smoke emissions from wildfires in northwestern Canada cantravel across the Atlantic Oceanto create hazy skies over Europe. Local air quality is impacted when smoke particles aloft descend to the surface. Turbulence, mixing, andsubsidencecan all drive the downward transport of smoke pollutants. Local and regional weather conditions can influence the build-up of wildfire smoke in the air we breathe. Multi-day smoke events are often caused by a weather phenomenon known as atemperature inversion— an atypical vertical temperature profile whereby air gets warmer (instead of cooler) with height. Since warm air rises, air and smoke under the inversion cannot escape because it’s cooler than the air above it, preventing it from rising, mixing and dispersing. This is how a temperature inversion acts as a cap under which smoke becomes trapped in the air we breathe. A shift in the atmospheric set-up and/or direction of the surface wind flow is required for the smoke pollution to clear. In our warming climate, more frequent hot, dry, windy conditions, known as fire weather, makes fires more likely to start and spread — feeding the flames and smoke that put health and safety at risk. According toClimate Central analysis, U.S. fire weather seasons have lengthened and intensified over the last 50 years (1973-2022), especially in the western U.S. Southern California, Texas, and New Mexico now see around two more months of fire weather compared to 1973. More modest increases in fire weather in the densely-populated eastern U.S., with nearly 28 million homes in burn-prone areas, put more people at risk.

Our warming climate results in more freeze-free days each year — giving plants more time to grow and release allergy-inducing pollen earlier in spring and later into fall. Climate Central analysis finds that fall warming since 1970 has extended ragweed’s freeze-free growing season in 164 U.S. cities — by 11 days on average. Cities in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Northwest saw some of the biggest increases. Climate Central’s reportSeasonal Allergies: Pollen and Moldreviews weather and climate trends that affect both spring and fall allergy seasons and the related health risks. This summer’s relentlessrecord heathas stuck around into fall. The planet just had arecord-shattering September— theseventh-warmestfor the U.S. This is bad news for the50 million peoplein the U.S. with allergies to ragweed pollen in the late summer and early fall. In most U.S. areas, ragweed pollen typicallypeaksin September and lasts through October. Butwarmer fall temperaturesextend the ragweed growing season. Ragweed, which is found in most U.S. states, is the main cause of fall allergies. A single ragweed plant can produce up to 1 billion pollen grains that are carried by wind and cause a range of symptoms. Ragweed can also thrive in both rural and urban areas. A 2003 study suggests that the urban heat island effect can even help ragweedgrow faster and produce more pollenin cities. SeeUrban Heat Hot Spotsto find the strongest urban heat islands within your city. How isfall warmingaffecting local fall allergy seasons?New Climate Central analysis explores this question. Studies have found that the length of ragweed pollen season across the U.S. — from Texas to North Dakota — isstrongly linked withthe number of fall days until the first frost. Climate Central therefore assessed how the number of consecutive freeze-free days (with minimum temperatures above 32°F) during the fall season (Sept-Nov) has changed since 1970 in 201 U.S. cities. The freeze-free fall season lengthened in 164 cities, or 82% of the 201 analyzed. Across these 164 cities, the freeze-free fall season lengthened by 11 days on average. The freeze-free fall season is now at least two weeks longer in 53 cities. Over half (58%) of these 53 cities were in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Northwest — consistent with research finding that ragweed pollen season hasgrown fastest at higher latitudes. The four cities where the fall freeze-free season has grown the most since 1970 are: Reno, Nev. (+39 days); Bend, Ore. (+33 days); Toledo, Ohio (+28 days); Boise, Idaho (+27 days). The widespread increase in freeze-free fall days can prolong allergy-inducing pollen production bythe 17 types of ragweedthat grow across the U.S. during the late summer and fall. Seasonal allergies can already last from early spring through late fall. But warming from carbon pollution results in more freeze-free days each year, giving plants more time to grow and release allergy-inducing pollen. A recent Climate Central analysis found that the total annual freeze-free season in 203 U.S. citiesgrew 15 days longeron average since 1970. This is consistent with peer-reviewed studies finding that human-caused warming has already led North American pollen seasons tolengthen by 20 days on averagefrom 1990 to 2018. Longer annualgrowing seasonsand pollen seasons are due both to:earlier spring warm-up(last spring frost happens earlier) andlater fall cool-down(first fall frost happens later). There are three different plant-based allergy seasons in North America: tree pollen in the spring, grass pollen in the early summer, and weed pollen such as ragweed in the summer and fall. A video from the University of Michigan showswhen each pollen season peaksacross the U.S. In addition to pollen, some molds (fungi that grow on soil and dead plants) can be allergenic. Different kinds of molds may release tiny spores throughout the year, but tend to peak in late summer and fall. Molds often grow on soil, leaf litter, and decaying plant matter, and their life cycles can therefore be closely linked to plant decay during fall. Studies have observed a significantincrease in mold sporeconcentrations when plants die or leaves fall during autumn. For people who have both pollen and mold allergies, this means that allergies can last for much of the year. Although outdoor mold isn’t as well-studied as pollen, climate change is likely affecting how both allergens impactpeople with allergies and asthma. Climate Central’s report,Seasonal Allergies: Pollen and Mold, reviews weather and climate trends that affect allergy season locally — including how increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere boosts pollen production, and why thunderstorms can increase the risk of asthma attacks. There are pollen and mold spore monitoring stations across the U.S. Local allergen counts and forecasts can be found through resources such as theNational Allergy Bureau. State or tribal agencies for environmental protection or public health may also have relevant air quality reports. The severity of the allergy season varies across the country.

There’s also been a more recent shift in precipitation patterns.Changing Precipitation Normals, a comparison of the last two normal periods (1991-2020 and 1981-2010), shows that: Annual average precipitation has increased east of the Rockies and decreased to the west, especially in the Southwestern U.S. Seasonal averages show high regional variation, with a strongwinter wettingsignal in the North Central U.S., and strongsummer and fall dryingsignals throughout the West, Southwest and Northwestern U.S. Changing precipitation patterns threaten the reliability of water suppliesfor drinking, irrigation, ecosystems, and industry in parts of the U.S. Managing and supplying water throughout the year with shifting precipitation patterns, aging infrastructure, and changing water demands is a challenge in our changing climate. Understanding average seasonal precipitation patterns can help identify places that may face high water supply vulnerability in our warming climate. Climate Central used over five decades of rainfall data (1969-70 through 2022-23) to summarize how total annual precipitation is distributed across the four seasons in the contiguous U.S. Winter precipitationdominates the total annual rainfall received in large areas of the western U.S. — especially in California and much of the Northwest. This means that regional water supplies are tightly coupled to year-to-year variation in winter precipitation. If winter precipitation is a bust in these areas, there’s far less water to meet demand throughout the rest of the year. Conversely, abundant winter precipitation (as during the back-to-backatmospheric riverevents of 2023) can alleviate drought and recharge reservoirs. Winter precipitation contributes far less to annual totals across the Northern Rockies and Plains and parts of the Upper Midwest. In both regions,summer precipitationinstead dominates annual precipitation totals — especially in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Nebraska. By contrast,spring and fall precipitationdon’t dominate the annual precipitation totals in any region; each season accounts for approximately one-quarter of annual precipitation in most regions. Many states in the Northeast and Ohio Valley receive about one-quarter of their total annual precipitation in each of the four seasons. By contrast, 14 states —including many in the West, Northwest, Upper Midwest, and Northern Rockies and Plains — receive at least one-third of their total annual precipitation in a single season. Among these states, the dominant precipitation season is either winter or summer. Nine states receive at least 40% of their annual precipitation in a single season.The lopsided seasonal distribution in these places may make them more vulnerable to both year-to-year variability and to the long-term precipitation shifts due to our warming climate. Future shifts toward wetter or drier seasons could be very disruptive for ecosystems, agriculture, and water management strategies that have all adapted to specific seasonal precipitation patterns in each region. Warmer air holds more moisture,increasing the potential for heavy rainfall (and resulting flood risk) in a warming climate. For every 1°F of warming, the air can hold an extra 4% of moisture. The U.S. has already warmed by 2.6°F since 1970 — meaning our atmosphere can hold about 10% more moisture on average. Climate models projecta shift towardless precipitation across all seasonsin the southwestern U.S. andmore winter and spring precipitationin the northern U.S. The Climate Explorertool from the U.S. Global Change Research Program shows how our warming climate is projected to affect seasonal and total annual precipitation across the contiguous U.S. The interactive tool can be used to search by city or zip code, modify future warming scenarios, and visualize the data for any decade through the end of this century.

https://www.climatecentral.org/report/climate-central-solutions-brief-nuclear-energy,Climate Central Solutions Brief: Nuclear Energy,,"See the full report Nuclear power plants generate aroundone-fifthof electricity in the United States and about10%globally. Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can be dispatched alongside variable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind; as such, it is often cited as a complement to renewables on the path to a decarbonized economy. However, risks and concerns associated with nuclear power’s costs, construction time, proliferation potential, and safety have influenced its development. This report explores the basics of nuclear electricity production, as well as the opportunities and impediments that may influence the role nuclear power will have in the future energy mix. See the full report Nuclear Energy BasicsNuclear Energy in the U.S. TodayTable: State-level nuclear energy capacity and generationNuclear in the Future U.S. Energy MixAdditional ResourcesGlossary of Key Terms Nuclear energyis produced throughfission—aprocessthat breaks the bonds between subatomic particles in the nuclei of some weakly-bound isotopes of heavy elements, such asUranium-235(U-235). Fuelenriched in the U-235 isotopeis most commonly used in U.S. nuclear reactors. Fission releases substantial energy that can be captured as heat to produce steam that drives turbines to generate electricity. Fission produces long-livedradioactive waste, in spent fuel as a byproduct, that requires safe long-term storage. Nuclear power plants are operated with highcapacity factors—which means that they are operated on average at 90% or more of their maximum capacity during a typical year. This is a primary reason that nuclear power is oftencitedas a reliable companion to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind—nuclear electricity can be available whenever those variable renewable sources are not. Fission does not produce greenhouse gases and therefore does not contribute to global warming, unlike combustion of thefossil fuels(i.e., coal, oil, and natural gas) that are currently the predominant source of electric power in the U.S. and worldwide. Although there are greenhouse gas emissions from thelife cycle of nuclear electricity production, such as from uranium mining and processing, these emissions are far less than from fossil fuel-based generation. The International Energy Agencyestimatesthat global nuclear energy helps to avoid nearly 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon pollution each year. In 2022, nuclear power generated about 772 million megawatt-hours (MWh) or18% of U.S. electricity—compared to around 22% from renewable energy sources and 60% from fossil fuels. (Renewable electricity generationsurpassed nuclear generationin the U.S. for the first time in 2021, and globally in 2019.) During 2022, there were 93 operational nuclear reactors at 55 power plants located across 28 states, with a total of more than 99,000 megawatts (MW) ofgeneration capacity(the maximum instantaneous amount of electricity that can be generated by the equipment). The largest single facility is thePalo Verde nuclear power plantin Arizona, which has a generation capacity of around 4,200 megawatts (MW) from three reactors. Palo Verde produced roughly 31,943,000 MWh of electricity in 2022—equivalent to the amount used by more than 3 millionaverage American homesin a year. Overall, Illinois is the state with the most nuclear capacity—around 12,400 MW from 11 reactors at 6 power plants. Nuclear power plants in Illinois produced roughly 98,870,000 MWh of electricity in 2022. Theactive U.S. nuclear fleet is agingandshrinking, as some reactors are closing without new reactors to replace them. As a consequence, the quantity of electricity generated by nuclear facilities isdecliningin the U.S. Theaverage age of operational U.S. nuclearreactors is around 40 years, or roughly halfway through the 80-year maximum potential lifespan for a nuclear facility under current regulations. (The initial license for a nuclear facility lasts 40 years, but operators can apply for two 20-year extensions. The vast majority of operating reactors in the U.S. have been granted at least one 20-year extension; but only two have been fully granted license renewals to extend operations for a total of 80 years.) Facilities that reach the end of their operational lifespans go through a process known asdecommissioning(permanently ending operations and restoring the site to its original condition) that can take decades to complete. More than two dozen reactors arecurrently undergoing decommissioningacross the country. Table 1.State-level data for nuclear energy capacity and generation (2022) in the U.S., expressed in megawatts (MW) and megawatt-hours (MWh), respectively.Appendix 1of this report provides additional details, including licensing dates for all operational reactors during 2022. (Sources: TheU.S. Energy Information Administrationand theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) *Palisadesfacility (Michigan) permanently closed in May 2022. These figures include data on generation from the facility (through May) but its capacity is not included here. Nuclear could continue to play amajor role in the global energy mix, depending on how effectively several new emerging technologies address key challenges. Cost issues and delays Nuclear energy construction projects have often experienced delays and cost overruns— some projects have taken decades to complete,with costs climbing significantly along the way. (For example, costs for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 exceeded$31 billion–more than twice the original budget). By contrast, the costs of renewable energy technologies havefallen substantiallyin recent years. As a result, the economic competitiveness of building additional nuclear plants is uncertain, particularly when life cycle costs are compared with those of other low-carbon energy sources. Continued operation of already-constructed plants, however, isfavoredby some climate activists to minimize current CO2 emissions from the electricity sector. Radioactive waste management Nearly90,000 metric tons of spent fuelhas been generated from nuclear energy in the U.S. since the first commercial facilities began operations in the 1950s, and around 2,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel are generated each year.TheNuclear Regulatory Commissionis responsible for regulating storage and disposal of this waste in the U.S.High-level waste(namely, spent nuclear fuel) isstoredin specially designed pools or dry casks, typically at reactor sites; but may also be stored at designated off-site facilities, such as non-operational reactors. At present, spent nuclear fuel isstoredat more than 70 facilities around the country, while the federal government continues long-runningeffortsto develop a permanent disposal facility. Current methods of storage are only interim solutions for radioactive waste, which remains dangerous to human health and ecosystems forhundreds of thousands of years. The primary proposed solution for long-term storage is buildingdeep geological repositories, which could isolate radioactive materials indefinitely. However, these projects can be time- and resource-intensive, and may face significant public opposition. The proposedYucca Mountain repositoryin Nevada has beencontestedsince the late 1980s when the site was first proposed, and activities werehalted indefinitely in 2011.  As a consensus report by the National Academy of Sciences recentlynoted, “... there is no clear path forward for the siting, licensing, and construction of a geologic repository for the disposal of highly radioactive waste (mainly commercial spent nuclear fuel).” Operational safety Although the vast majority of nuclear power plants have operated safely for decades, some high-profile incidents have heightened public concerns about safety. Chief among these are: the partial meltdown of the Unit 2 reactor atThree Mile Island(Pennsylvania) in 1979; the explosion atChernobyl(Ukraine) in 1986; and the accident at theFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station(Japan) in 2011 following a major earthquake and tsunami. Public opinion Results from multiple polls show that the American public remains ambivalent about nuclear energy, influenced partly by safety concerns. Asurvey by Pew Research Center in 2022found that public opinion is mixed, while another byGallup in 2023concluded that support for nuclear energy has ticked up modestly since 2015. According to a 2017 study, around 81% of the U.S. public believes that local residents should have input on nuclear siting decisions, while around 56% think they should have veto power. Community opposition often complicates siting of nuclear power and waste disposal facilities. To minimize conflicts within communities where nuclear facilities are proposed, the U.S. Department of Energy utilizes aconsent-based approachto prioritize community engagement. Security risks Nuclear facilities can be vulnerable to sabotage and theft of nuclear materials. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring and regulatingsafeguards and security measuresat nuclear energy facilities in the U.S. to guard against these threats. Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine since 2022 hasintensifiedconcerns about nuclear safety in wartime, as outlined by the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration: “Russia’s Disregard for Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine.” An additional concern relates to nuclear-weapons proliferation. As experts at the National Defense University haveobserved, “Civilian nuclear power plants themselves are not considered a high proliferation risk because it is difficult to make weapons-usable material from reactor fuel. The principal proliferation risk is that states can use the civilian nuclear fuel cycle as a source for the material, technology, and expertise needed to develop nuclear weapons.” Near- and long-term technological advances could help nuclear power remain in the U.S. energy mix, particularly if the industry is able to reduce costs, shorten construction timelines, and gain public support. It is not yet clear whether SMRs will be cost-competitive compared to other low-carbon options. Emerging technologies: Small modular reactors and Gen IV reactors Small modular reactors (SMRs)are emerging designs for nuclear reactors, intended to reduce costs and operate more safely than large, traditional reactors. SMRs’ smaller footprints can also offer more flexibility for siting, and their parts can be prefabricated to standard design, which could reduce construction costs, time, and capital investment. SMRs are being designed with enhanced safety features, as well as the capacity to utilize alternative coolants, such as salts or gases, that could offer additional safety and economic benefits. The U.S. Department of Energy has identified small nuclear reactors as keycomponents in future planning. SMRs have yet to be deployed in the U.S., but the Nuclear Regulatory Commissiongave its first certification of an SMR design in early 2023, clearing the way for it to be considered for U.S. projects. (SMR projects are underway in other countries, including Russia, China, and Argentina.) Generation IV reactorsare also under development, the most prominent of which is theNatriumfast reactor by TerraPower. In August 2023, TerraPowerannouncedthat it had purchased land in Wyoming near a retiring coal facility as the site for a demonstration project, which is funded in part by the Department of Energy. Long-term storage facilities Permanent, underground storage for radioactive waste was envisioned in the early days of commercial nuclear power. After decades in development, Finland is building the world’s first of these facilities, known asOnkalo, which could be operational by the mid-2020s. may be complete in 2023. Other repositories like it will be necessary to permanently house radioactive waste produced around the world by nuclear fission. Fusion: the next generation of nuclear Another nuclear process known asfusioncreates a tremendous amount of energy—significantly more than fission per unit of fuel mass—largelywithout the byproduct of radioactive waste, and without the same risks of uncontrolled reactions, or meltdowns. Unlike fission, which releases energy by splitting heavier atoms into lighter ones, fusion produces energy by combining atoms to form new elements—primarily helium.However, scientists have not been able to sustain these reactions for long enough periods of time to reliably produce energy. Although there was amajor research breakthroughannounced in late 2022 and additional progress inAugust 2023, most experts believe that fusion is unlikely to be available at scale untilmid-century, or later.

Analysis using theClimate Shift Index(CSI) — Climate Central’s daily local temperature attribution system — indicates that human-caused climate change significantly elevated temperatures over the last 12 months. The analysis looks at daily average temperatures and heat waves and includes data for 175 countries, 154 states/provinces, and 920 major cities. With an average warming of more than 1.3°C, the past 12 months were the hottest on record.El Niñois just beginning to boost temperatures, but based on historical patterns, most of the effect will be felt next year. Rapidly reducing carbon pollution every year is required to halt the warming trend. Over the entire year-long period, 90% percent of people (7.3 billion) experienced at least 10 days of temperatures very strongly affected by climate change, and 73% (5.8 billion) experienced more than a month’s worth of these temperatures.These days had a CSI of 3 or higher; CSI level 3 indicates that human-caused climate change made those temperatures at least three times more likely. We also examined exposure to dangerous, extreme temperatures, especially where conditions persisted for at least 5 days. We found that1 in 4 people (1.9 billion) experienced a five-day heat wave (at minimum) that was strongly influenced by carbon pollution.These multi-day heat streaks had a CSI of 2 or higher, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperatures at least two times more likely. Our findings confirm that climate burdens are both inequitable and emerging everywhere around the world. Least developed countries and small island nations had higher exposure to climate-driven heat, but climate change touched every country, and intense heat waves occurred in the U.S., Europe, India, and China.

Learn moreabout the report including FAQs, timelines, and a chapter summary. The National Climate Assessment (NCA) is an authoritative assessment of all aspects of climate science, with a focus on the United States. A new NCA, mandated by Congress in theGlobal Change Research Act of 1990, is presented to the President and Congress every four years. NCA reports assess the many ways that climate change affects the U.S. natural environment, agriculture, energy, land and water resources, human health, social systems, biodiversity, and much more. According toThe White House, “the National Climate Assessment is the preeminent source of climate information for the United States, used by hundreds of thousands of people across the country and around the world. This report assesses the science of climate change, its impacts, and our options for reducing present and future risk.” The NCA is used by communities, cities and states, the private sector (e.g., agriculture, energy), and the federal government to prepare for the current and future impacts of climate change in the U.S. Because these reports are published approximately every four years, each installment is an up-to-date  valuable resource for years into the future. TheU.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)is responsible for producing NCA reports. The USGCRP is made up of14 federal departments and agenciesthat conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society and nature. NOAA is the administrative agency for the upcoming NCA. NCA reports don’t make policy recommendations or evaluate specific policies. They are peer-reviewed technical assessments, written by hundreds of scientists and other climate experts, that summarize the latest available knowledge. Learn more about report authors and the drafting and review processhere. The NCA5 process started in 2020. A draft opened for public comment and scientific review in the fall of 2022. During summer 2023, the NCA5 went through final revisions. The previous installment, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, was released in 2017-2018 over two volumes: Climate Science Special Reportcovered foundational climate science Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United Statesfocused on impacts and future pathways. NCA5 is a technical scientific assessment and does not make policy recommendations, consistent with all previous NCA reports. The NCA5 has four major thematic sections: Physical Science:reviewing past and projected future climate trends and changes in the Earth system National Topics:assessing trends and impacts on 17 key topics including: water, energy, forests, biodiversity, coasts and oceans, cities, agriculture, air quality, health, economics, and more Regions:summarizing current and future climate risks in ten U.S. regions, with a chapter for each: Northeast; Southeast; U.S. Caribbean; Midwest; Northern Great Plains; Southern Great Plains; Northwest; Southwest; Alaska; and Hawai‘i and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands Responses:focusing on adaptation and mitigation options and scenarios for the U.S. There are many exciting new developments in NCA5. Here are a few: Social science and justice.Plans for NCA5 include new chapters that focus on economics and social systems and justice. Focus features.A new set of “focus” features will explore emerging or cross-cutting topics: compound extremes, western wildfires, COVID-19 and climate change, risks to supply chains, and blue carbon. Art x Climate.The NCA5 will feature visual art by 92 artists of all ages from across the U.S., the result of a first-ever open call for art to feature in an NCA. Spanish translation.During the public comment period, a Spanish translation of the draft U.S. Caribbean chapter was made available for public comment. Details about Spanish versions of the full NCA5 are not yet available. The NCA5 will assess differentindicators of climate changein each major U.S. region. Climate change indicators are specific data or metrics that are linked to our warming climate. Long-term trends in climate indicators are evidence of the local effects of global change. Climate Matters often features indicators of climate change.

Winters have warmed in 233 U.S. locations from 1970 to 2022 — by 3.8°F on average. Warm winter days now happen more often. About 84% of locations now have at least seven more winter days above normal than in 1970. In our warming world the coldest days aren’t as cold, and cold snaps are shrinking. Warming winters affect public health, water supplies, agriculture, and recreation. Winter temperature trends November temperature trends and Thanksgiving extremes Holiday graphics:November temperature trends and Thanksgiving extremes Climate Central analyzed November temperature trends in 241 U.S. locations from 1970 to 2022. Most locations (82%, or 205) saw November temperatures rise during that period — by 2.1°F on average. ________________________________________________________________________________ The most rapid warming in the U.S. has generally occurred when and where it’s coldest, includingat night, innorthern partsof the country—andduring winter. Winter (December, January, February) is thefastest warming seasonfor the majority (74%) of U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. Locations with the fastest winter warming since 1970 are found from coast to coast, but especially in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. Climate Central analyzed winter average temperature data from 240 U.S. locations (see Methodology) to see how and where winters have warmed from 1970 to 2022: Average winter temperatures increased in 233 (97%) of locations since 1970. Over that period, the average winter warming across these 233 locations was 3.8°F. Average winter temperatures warmed by 2°F or more in 206 (86%) of locations. Winter warmed the most, on average, in locations across the Upper Midwest (4.7°F), Northeast (4.6°F), and Ohio Valley (4.3°F). The top-five winter warming locations were: Burlington, Vt. (7.7°F), Albany, Ga. (7°F), Chattanooga, Tenn. (6.7°F), Milwaukee, Wis. (6.7°F), and Concord, N.H. (6.6°F). The warming season is also reflected in the growing number of winter days with temperatures above the 1991-2020 winter normal temperature for that location. Since 1970, the average number of warmer-than-normal winter days has increased in 229 (95%) of the 240 locations analyzed. The majority of locations (84%, or 202) now experience at least seven more warmer-than-normal winter days than they did in 1970. The rise in warmer-than-normal winter days was highest among locations in the Northeast (16 more days on average) and Upper Midwest (14 more days on average). The cities that saw the largest increase in warmer-than-normal winter days since 1970 were: Las Vegas, Nev. (30 more days), Honolulu, Hawai’i (27 more days), and San Francisco, Ca. (27 more days). Theannual number of freezing nights has droppedin 204 U.S. locations from 1970 to 2022. The average change across these 204 locations was 13 fewer freezing nights. From 1970 to 2021, 97% of 244 U.S. locations analyzed experienced shrinkingwinter cold snaps. Cold snaps shrank by 6 days on average across all 244 stations from 1970 to 2021. From 1970 to 2020, annualminimum temperatureswarmed by at least 1°F in 98% of 244 U.S. locations.

Average temperatures and days above normal were calculated for each winter (December, January, February) from 1969-70 to 2022-23 using data obtained from theApplied Climate Information System. Winter days above normal are defined as the number of days where the average temperature was above the 1991-2020 NOAA/NCEI climate normal. Climate Central's local analyses include 247 stations. However, for reported data summaries based on linear trends, only 240 stations are included due to data completeness measures that were not met by seven stations: Bend, Ore.; Dothan, Ala.; Hattiesburg, Miss., Hazard, Ky; Panama City, Fla.; Terre Haute, Ind.; and Wheeling, W.Va. November average temperatures from 1970-2022 were retrieved from theApplied Climate Information System(ACIS). Local Thanksgiving climate extremes were also retrieved from ACIS, but included each station’s entire period of record (POR). Climate Central's November/Thanksgiving analysis included 247 stations. Only 241 stations were included in reported data summaries based on linear trends, however, completeness measures that were not met by six stations: Dothan, Ala.; Hattiesburg, Miss., Hazard, Ky; Terre Haute, Ind.; Twin Falls, Idaho; and Wheeling, W.Va.

Since 1970, the coldest day of the year has warmed by 7°F on average across 242 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central. Yearly coldest temperatures rose at least 1°F in 97% of locations across every U.S. region. Coldest days have warmed the most on average in the Ohio Valley (8.7°F) and Northwest (8.4°F). Warming during the coldest time of year has year-round effects — on seasonal allergies, fruit and nut crops, water supplies, winter sports, and more. While extreme and dangerous cold events like last week’s still occur in a warming world, cold extremes are generally becomingless frequent and milderacross the U.S. Winter cold snaps like last week’s are also getting shorter, according to Climate Central. From 1970 to 2021,winter cold snaps got shorter— by six days on average — in 97% of 244 U.S. locations. Much of the U.S. typically experiences thecoldest days of the yearin mid- to late-January. But as the planet warms, those coldest days are warming up, too. Climate Central analyzed trends in minimum annual temperatures in 242 U.S. locations (see Methodology) to see how the coldest days of the year have changed from 1970 to 2023. The analysis shows that the coldest days are losing their chill: Across all 242 locations, annual coldest temperatures have warmed by 7°F on average since 1970. Yearly coldest temperatures rose at least 1°F in 234 (97%) of locations — and by at least 5°F in 179 (74%) of locations. A rise of at least 10°F was recorded in 50 locations — one-third of which were located in the Ohio Valley. EveryU.S. climate regionhas experienced an average rise of at least 4.6°F in their yearly coldest temperatures since 1970. Coldest days warmed the most on average in the Ohio Valley (8.7°F) and Northwest (8.4°F) regions. The locations with the largest increase in coldest temperatures since 1970 were: Boise, Idaho (15.7°F); Las Vegas, Nev. (14.3°F);  Idaho Falls, Idaho (14.3°F); and Reno, Nev. (14°F). Extremely cold days still occur in our warming climate. But asevery season warms, extremely cold days are increasingly outnumbered by extremely warm days year-round, including during colder months. Climate Central analyzeddaily temperature recordsover the entire period of record at 247 U.S. locations. Most local observations show daily heat records outnumbering cold records in recent decades. Record-setting hot and cold temperatures are part of natural variation in daily weather. But as the planet warms overall, heat extremes are expected to becomemore frequent and intense. In a stable climate, extreme highs and lows would each account for about half of all temperature records. But since the late 1970s, daily heat records havebecome increasingly more commonthan daily cold records across the U.S. — a trend that isprojected to increasewith additional warming.

Due partly to an ongoing El Niño acting on top of long-term warming caused by burning fossil fuels,global temperatures in 2023were warmer than any previous year on record. A streak of continuously record-shattering months and seasons began in June 2023 and is still ongoing. The planet’s fever is forecast to continue into 2024 withan extra warming boost from El Niñolayered on top of the long-term warming trend driven by carbon pollution. El Niño,the warm ENSO state, is expected to continuethrough June 2024. Historically, El Niño winters have been associated with warmer-than-normal winter temperatures across the northern U.S., increased hurricane activity in the Pacific, and more frequentatmospheric riverson the West Coast. According toClimate Central analysis, 22% of the 1,542 weather-related power outages between 2000-2021 were caused bywinter weather.
